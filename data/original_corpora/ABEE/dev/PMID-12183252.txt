Occurrence of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes aac(6')-Ib, dfrA5, dfrA12, and  ereA2 in class I integrons in non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholerae strains in India. 

Molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in Vibrio cholerae belonging to  non-O1, non-O139 serogroups isolated during 1997 to 1998 in Calcutta, India, were  investigated. Out of the 94 strains examined, 22 strains were found to have class  I integrons. The gene cassettes identified were dfrA1, dfrA15, dfrA5, and dfrA12   for trimethoprim; aac(6')-Ib for amikacin and tobramycin; aadA1 and aadA2 for  streptomycin and spectinomycin; and ereA2 for erythromycin resistance. To our  knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of dfrA5, dfrA12, aac(6')-Ib,  and ereA2 cassettes in class I integrons of V. cholerae. Forty-three of 94  strains also had plasmids, and out of these, 14 contained both class I integrons   and plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern hybridization  revealed that in the 14 plasmid-bearing strains, class I integrons resided either  on chromosomes, on plasmids, or on both. Our results indicated that besides class  I integrons and plasmids, a conjugative transposon element, SXT, possibly  contributed to the multiple antibiotic resistance.
