Electromagnetic energy and food processing.

The use of electromagnetic energy in food processing is reviewed with respect to   food safety, nutritional quality, and organoleptic quality. The effects of  nonionizing radiation sources such as microwave and radio-frequency energy and  ionizing radiation sources, e.g. radioactive cobalt-60 and caesium-137, on the  inactivation of microbes and nutrients are compared with those of conventional  heating processes both in terms of their kinetic behavior and their mechanisms of  interaction with foods. The kinetics of microwave and conventional thermal  inactivation are considered for a generalized nth-order model based on time and  temperature conditions. However, thermal inactivation effects are often modeled  by 1st-order kinetics. Microbial and nutrient inactivation by ionizing sources  are considered for a 1st-order model based on radiation dose. Both thermal and  radiation resistance concepts are reviewed and some typical values of radiation  resistance are given for sensitive vegetative bacterial cells, yeasts, and molds   and for resistant bacterial spores and viruses. Nonionizing microwave energy  sources are increasingly used in home and industrial food processing and are  well-accepted by the American public. But, despite recent Food and Drug  Administration approval of low and intermediate ionizing radiation dose levels  for grains and other plants products and the fact that irradiated foods are sold   in more than 20 countries of the world, public fears in the U.S. about nuclear  energy may limit the role of ionizing radiation in food processing and  preservation and may also limit the use of nuclear fuels as an alternate source  of electrical energy.
