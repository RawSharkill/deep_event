Characterization of the nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance (cmlA) gene of  the In4 integron of Tn1696: similarity of the product to transmembrane transport   proteins. 

Integrons constitute a novel family of DNA elements which evolved by  site-specific integration of discrete units between two conserved segments. On  the In4 integron of Tn1696, a precisely inserted gene cassette of 1,549 bp  conferring nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance (cmlA) is present between the   streptomycin spectinomycin resistance (aadA2) gene cassette and the 3'-conserved   segment of the integron. In this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of the  cmlA gene cassette of Tn1696, show its similarity to bacterial efflux systems and  other transport proteins, and present evidence for alterations that its  expression exerts on bacterial membranes. The cmlA gene cassette apparently  carries its own promoter(s), a situation that has not heretofore been observed in  the integrons of multiresistance plasmids and transposons of gram-negative  bacteria. One or more of these promoters were shown to be functionally active in   expressing a cat marker gene from promoter-probe vectors. The putative CmlA  polypeptide appears to provoke a reduction of the content of the major porins  OmpA and OmpC.
