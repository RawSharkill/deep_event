Mechanisms underlying expression of Tn10 encoded tetracycline resistance.

Tetracycline resistance determinants encoding active efflux of the drug are  widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria and unique with respect to genetic  organization and regulation of expression. Each determinant consists of two genes  called tetA and tetR, which are oriented with divergent polarity, and between  them is a central regulatory region with overlapping promoters and operators. The  amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins are 43-78% identical. The resistance  protein TetA is a tetracycline/metal-proton antiporter located in the cytoplasmic  membrane, while the regulatory protein TetR is a tetracycline inducible  repressor. TetR binds via a helix-turn-helix motif to the two tet operators,  resulting in repression of both genes. A detailed model of the repressor-operator  complex has been proposed on the basis of biochemical and genetic data. The tet  genes are differentially regulated so that repressor synthesis can occur before  the resistance protein is expressed. This has been demonstrated for the  Tn10-encoded tet genes and may be a common property of all tet determinants, as  suggested by the similar locations of operators with respect to promoters.  Induction is mediated by a tetracycline metal complex and requires only nanomolar  concentrations of the drug. This is the most sensitive effector-inducible system   of transcriptional regulation known to date. The crystal structure of the  TetR-tetracycline/metal complex shows the Tet repressor in the induced, non-DNA  binding conformation. The structural interpretation of many noninducible TetR  mutants has offered insight into the conformational changes associated with the  switch between inducing and repressing structures of TetR. Tc is buried in the  core of TetR, where it is held in place by multiple contacts to the protein.
