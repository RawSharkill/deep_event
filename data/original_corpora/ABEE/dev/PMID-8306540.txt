Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network: a new approach to university-industry  relationships.

Bacterial diseases are a substantial problem worldwide. Their diagnosis and  therapy form the basis of a multibillion dollar industry. This industry is  dynamic and is continuously revitalized by research. The Canadian Bacterial  Diseases Network (CBDN) was established to capitalize on the enhanced  opportunities that now exist for the rapid progression of an idea from  conceptualization to implementation and, ultimately, commercialization. CBDN is  one of 15 Networks of Centres of Excellence, a Federal Government initiative  whose intention is to improve Canada's economic competitiveness in the global  market. CBDN research involves fundamental science, is broadly-based, and  encompasses all aspects of bacterial diseases. Current projects include the  investigations of strategies to block Pseudomonas aeruginosa binding to  epithelial cells and a novel anti-toxin approach for Escherichia coli. Also CBDN   is investigating the basis for antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria,  and is devising improved procedures for overcoming such resistance mechanisms.  CBDN is only 28 months into its first 4-year mandate; however, considerable  successes have been enjoyed to date.
