Antibiotic-resistant enterococci and the changing face of surgical infections.

BACKGROUND: Enterococci have not been thought to play an important role in  intra-abdominal infections because of their relatively low virulence. However,  this notion is changing because of the recent emergence of these microbes as  significant nosocomial pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To review the mechanisms of  antibiotic resistance of enterococci and to discuss the significance of  multidrug-resistant enterococci in surgical infections. DATA SOURCES: Medical and  basic science literature relating to enterococci. DATA SYNTHESIS: In addition to   having intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics, enterococci have the  ability to acquire resistant genes through the exchange of plasmids or  transposons from other bacterial species. Moreover, enterococci have been shown  to transmit these genes to other bacterial species in turn. The extensive  resistance of these microorganisms has led to their emergence as significant  nosocomial pathogens, ranking second only to Escherichia coli in the number of  pathogenic isolates recovered from patients in intensive care units. There has  also been a marked increase in vancomycin resistant enterococcal infections in  surgical patients in the last 5 years. Some studies associate the prior use of  vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins with the emergence of these  strains. Overall, enterococcal infections are associated with increased morbidity  and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the marked resistance of enterococci to  antibiotics and their ability to disseminate resistance genes, these microbes  have become important pathogens. Enterococci pose a threat to surgical patients,   often causing significant therapeutic dilemmas.
