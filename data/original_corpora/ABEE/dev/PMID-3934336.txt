Isolation and physiological characterization of mitomycin  C sensitive/UV-sensitive mutants in Bacteroides fragilis.

Mutants of Bacteroides fragilis sensitive to mitomycin C were isolated after  mutagenesis with ethyl methane sulphonate. One mutant (MTC25) was markedly  sensitive to mitomycin C but was unaffected as regards UV sensitivity; another  mutant (UVS9) was sensitive to UV radiation but was only moderately sensitive to   mitomycin C. Caffeine decreased the survival after UV-irradiation of the  wild-type, MTC25 and UVS9 strains by the same relative amount. Aerobic liquid  holding recovery occurred in each of the three strains. The MTC25 and UVS9  mutants showed reduced host cell phage reactivation. The wild-type, MTC25 and  UVS9 strains all showed UV- and H2O2-induced phage reactivation. The  physiological characterization of the MTC25 and UVS9 mutants indicates that it is  possible to differentiate between mechanisms for the repair of mitomycin C  and  UV-induced DNA damage in B. fragilis.
