A restriction endonuclease analysis of the bacterial plasmid controlling the  ecoRI restriction and modification of DNA.

Genetic analyses of DNA restriction and modification mechanisms have been  encumbered by the inability to rigorously select for mutant phenotypes associated  with these systems. The application of restriction endonucleases has now proved  to be a successful approach to the genetic analyses of small genomes that are  recalcitrant to the more standard genetic techniques. Restriction endonucleases  EcoRI and HindIII were used to analyze the structure of the plasmid genome  responsible for the EcoRI restriction endonuclease and modification methylase.  This plasmid in the original clinical isolate of Escherichia coli appears to be  identical to the ColE 1 plasmid except for a 1.95 kilobase pair segment which  contains these genes. A preliminary restriction map of this plasmid is presented.
