16S rRNA mutation associated with tetracycline resistance in a gram-positive  bacterium. 

A genetic basis for tetracycline resistance in cutaneous propionibacteria was  suggested by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes from 16  susceptible and 21 resistant clinical isolates and 6 laboratory-selected  tetracycline resistant mutants of a susceptible strain. Fifteen clinical isolates  resistant to tetracycline were found to have cytosine instead of guanine at a  position cognate with Escherichia coli 16S rRNA base 1058 in a region important  for peptide chain termination and translational accuracy known as helix 34.  Cytosine at base 1058 was not detected in the laboratory mutants or the  tetracycline susceptible strains. The apparent mutation was recreated by  site-directed mutagenesis in the cloned E. coli ribosomal operon, rrnB, encoded  by pKK3535.E. coli strains carrying the mutant plasmid were more resistant to  tetracycline than those carrying the wild-type plasmid both in MIC determinations  and when grown in tetracycline containing liquid medium. These data are  consistent with a role for the single 16S rRNA base mutation in clinical  tetracycline resistance in cutaneous propionibacteria.
