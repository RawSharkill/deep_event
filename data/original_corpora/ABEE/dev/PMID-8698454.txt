Bacterially induced bone destruction: mechanisms and misconceptions.

Normal bone remodelling requires the coordinated regulation of the genesis and  activity of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages. Any interference with these  integrated cellular systems can result in dysregulation of remodelling with the  consequent loss of bone matrix. Bacteria are important causes of bone pathology  in common conditions such as periodontitis, dental cysts, bacterial arthritis,  and osteomyelitis. It is now established that many of the bacteria implicated in   bone diseases contain or produce molecules with potent effects on bone cells.  Some of these molecules, such as components of the gram-positive cell walls  (lipoteichoic acids), are weak stimulators of bone resorption in vitro, while  others (PMT, cpn60) are as active as the most active mammalian osteolytic factors  such as cytokines like IL-1 and TNF. The complexity of the integration of bone  cell lineage development means that there are still question marks over the  mechanism of action of many well-known bone-modulatory molecules such as  parathyroid hormone. The key questions which must be asked of the now-recognized   bacterial bone-modulatory molecules are as follows: (i) what cell population do  they bind to, (ii) what is the nature of the receptor and postreceptor events,  and (iii) is their action direct or dependent on the induction of secondary  extracellular bone-modulating factors such as cytokines, eicosanoids, etc. In the  case of LPS, this ubiquitous gram-negative polymer probably binds to osteoblasts   or other cells in bone through the CD14 receptor and stimulates them to release  cytokines and eicosanoids which then induce the recruitment and activation of  osteoclasts. This explains the inhibitor effects of nonsteroidal and anticytokine  agents on LPS-induced bone resorption. However, other bacterial factors such as  the potent toxin PMT may act by blocking the normal maturation pathway of the  osteoblast lineage, thus inducing dysregulation in the tightly regulated process   of resorption and replacement of bone matrix. At the present time, it is not  possible to define a general mechanism by which bacteria promote loss of bone  matrix. Many bacteria are capable of stimulating bone matrix loss, and the  information available would suggest that each organism possesses different  factors which interact with bone in different ways. With the rapid increase in  antibiotic resistance, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus and M.  tuberculosis, organisms responsible for much bone pathology in developed  countries only two generations ago, we would urge that much greater attention  should be focused on the problem of bacterially induced bone remodelling in order  to define pathogenetic mechanisms which could be therapeutic targets for the  development of new treatment modalities.
