Molecular biology, virulence, and pathogenicity of mycobacteria.

The diseases resulting from infections with Mycobacterium species are important  sources of morbidity and mortality throughout the world today, with particularly   devastating effects in tropical and developing countries. Almost 2 billion people  have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of  tuberculosis, and approximately 3 million people die each year from this disease.  Tuberculosis also has re-emerged as an important public health problem in the  United States, and this resurgence has been accompanied by an increased incidence  of tuberculosis resistant to the standardly used anti-tuberculosis drugs.  Researchers' ability to investigate the molecular basis of the pathogenicity and   drug resistance of the mycobacteria has been hampered by a lack of appropriate  experimental tools. However, during the past 5 years, tremendous progress has  been made in the development of the molecular biology of mycobacteria, and  molecular tools are now available for detailed analysis of their genetics and for  elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of their pathogenicity. The development  of these tools is briefly reviewed, and the uses of the tools to investigate drug  resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to identify mycobacterial virulence  factors, and to explore intracellular survival strategies are described.
