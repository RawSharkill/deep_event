The emerging NDM carbapenemases. 

Carbapenems were the last beta-lactams retaining near-universal  anti-Gram-negative activity, but carbapenemases are spreading, conferring  resistance. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) enzymes are the latest  carbapenemases to be recognized and since 2008 have been reported worldwide,  mostly in bacteria from patients epidemiologically linked to the Indian  subcontinent, where they occur widely in hospital and community infections, and  also in contaminated urban water. The main type is NDM-1, but minor variants  occur. NDM enzymes are present largely in Enterobacteriaceae, but also in  non-fermenters and Vibrionaceae. Dissemination predominantly involves transfer of  the blaNDM-1 gene among promiscuous plasmids and clonal outbreaks. Bacteria with   NDM-1 are typically resistant to nearly all antibiotics, and reliable detection  and surveillance are crucial.
