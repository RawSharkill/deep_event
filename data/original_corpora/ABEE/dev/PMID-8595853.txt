Salmonella typhimurium acrB-like gene: identification and role in resistance to  biliary salts and detergents and in murine infection.

Salmonella serotype typhimurium transpositional mutants altered in resistance to   biliary salts and detergents were isolated previously. We have characterized  further the LX1054 mutant strain, the most sensitive of them. The chromosomal DNA  segment flanking transposon insertion was cloned and sequenced. The highest level  of identity was found for the acrB (formerly acrE) gene of Escherichia coli, a  gene encoding a drug efflux pump of the Acr family. LX1054 exhibited a reduced  capacity to colonize the intestinal tract. After passages in mice, the mutant  strain lost the sensitive phenotype. In vitro, a resumption of growth appeared  after 17 h of culture in medium with cholate or other tested biological or  chemical detergents. Then, the acquired resistant phenotype seemed stable. The  data suggested a role of S. typhimurium acrB-like gene in resistance to biliary  salts and detergents and in mice intestinal colonization. However, the local and   transient sensitivity observed in vivo, and the in vitro adaptations suggest that  several detergent-resistance mechanisms operate in S. typhimurium.
