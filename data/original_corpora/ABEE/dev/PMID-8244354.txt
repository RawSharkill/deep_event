The incidence of gonorrhoea and the antibiotic sensitivity of gonococci in  Australia, 1981-1991. The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme.

OBJECTIVE: To review and analyse the changing incidence of gonorrhoea and the  increasing antibiotic resistance in gonococci in Australia from 1981 to 1991.  DESIGN: Use of data from the sample of gonorrhoea in Australia examined by the  Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme (AGSP), a continuing long-term  multi-centric study of gonococcal disease and gonococcal susceptibility to  antibiotics, over the period 1 July, 1981 to 30 June, 1991. RESULTS: Over 32,000   cases and strains from defined sources were examined in the 10 year study period.  The number of cases of gonorrhoea in the sample decline from a peak of 6599 in  1982-1983 to 1121 in the final year under review, a reduction of 83%. Periods  when greater than average reductions in incidence occurred in different groups  were noted. Ano-rectal gonorrhoea in men decreased sharply in 1985 during an  overall decline of 92.5% recorded between 1 July, 1981 to 30 June, 1987. However,  the incidence of ano-rectal cases in males rose in subsequent years while  gonorrhoea, overall, continued to decrease and at a greater rate after 1985.  Antibiotic resistance in gonococci in Australia was manifested both as a  progressive increase in the levels of intrinsic resistance to the penicillins and  through the appearance and spread of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae  (PPNG). At the end of the review period in June, 1991, 8.8% of gonococcal  isolates in Australia showed high levels of intrinsic resistance to the  penicillins and 13% of strains were PPNG. These separate mechanisms of resistance  appeared at different times in different parts of Australia, and their importance  also varied throughout the country. Most infections with PPNG were acquired by  men overseas whereas most women with PPNG were infected locally. Endemic spread  of PPNG was a significant problem in Sydney and Melbourne, but decreased in  importance in the later years of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In the past decade a  large reduction in the incidence of gonorrhoea and, by implication, other STDs  has occurred in the past decade in Australia. In some groups of patients the  decline in incidence is continuing while in others a slight increase has been  noted. Resistance to antibiotics of gonococci in Australia was mainly restricted   to the penicillins, but through both chromosomal and plasmid-mediated mechanisms.  This resistance was seen particularly in Sydney and Melbourne where endemic  cycles of transmission of PPNG were established, and in infected travellers from   S-E Asia in other centres. Valid and comparable, and regionally relevant data are  a continuing requirement for assessing and modifying antibiotic treatment  regimens for gonococcal disease.
