Deleterious mutations in small subunit ribosomal RNA identify functional sites  and potential targets for antibiotics. 

Many clinically useful antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis in bacterial   pathogens by inhibiting ribosome function. The sites of action of known drugs are  limited in number, are composed primarily of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and coincide  with functionally critical centers of the ribosome. Nucleotide alterations within  such sites are often deleterious. To identify functional sites and potential  sites of antibiotic action in the ribosome, we prepared a random mutant library  of rRNA genes and selected dominant mutations in 16S rRNA that interfere with  cell growth. Fifty-three 16S rRNA positions were identified whose mutation  inhibits protein synthesis. Mutations were ranked according to the severity of  the phenotype, and the detrimental effect of several mutations on translation was  verified in a specialized ribosome system. Analysis of the polysome profiles of  mutants suggests that the majority of the mutations directly interfered with  ribosome function, whereas a smaller fraction of mutations affected assembly of  the small ribosomal subunit. Twelve of the identified mutations mapped to sites  targeted by known antibiotics, confirming that deleterious mutations can be used   to identify antibiotic targets. About half of the mutations coincided with known   functional sites in the ribosome, whereas the rest of the mutations affected  ribosomal sites with less clear functional significance. Four clusters of  deleterious mutations in otherwise unremarkable ribosomal sites were identified,   suggesting their functional importance and potential as antibiotic targets.
