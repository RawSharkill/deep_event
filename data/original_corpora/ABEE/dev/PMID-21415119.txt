Molecular insights into the mechanism of phenotypic tolerance to rifampicin  conferred on mycobacterial RNA polymerase by MsRbpA. 

The protein MsRbpA from Mycobacterium smegmatis rescues RNA polymerase (RNAP)  from the inhibitory effect of rifampicin (Rif). We have reported previously that   MsRbpA interacts with the beta-subunit of RNAP and that the effect of MsRbpA on  Rif resistant (Rif(R)) RNAP is minimal. Here we attempted to gain molecular  insights into the mechanism of action of this protein with respect to its role in  rescuing RNAP from Rif-mediated transcription inhibition. Our experimental  approach comprised multiple-round transcription assays, fluorescence  spectroscopy, MS and surface plasmon resonance in order to meet the above  objective. Based on our molecular studies we propose here that Rif is released  from its binding site in the RNAP-Rif complex in the presence of MsRbpA.  Biophysical studies reveal that the location of MsRbpA on RNAP is at the junction  of the beta- and beta'-subunits, close to the Rif-binding site and the (i+1) site  on RNAP.
