Translocation of sequences encoding antibiotic resistance from the chromosome to   a receptor plasmid in Salmonella ordonez.

Salmonella ordonez strain BM2000 carries kanamycin (Km), ampicillin (Ap),  spectinomycin (Sp), chloramphenicol (Cm), tetracycline (Tc), and sulfonamide (Su)  resistance and production of colicin Ib (Cib). The Km and Cib characters were  carried by a 97 kb IncI1 plasmid (pIP565). In addition to the Km and Cib traits,   all or part of the other antibiotic resistance (R) determinants could be  transferred by conjugation from S. ordonez to Escherichia coli where all the  acquired characters are borne by an IncI1 plasmid, designated complete or partial  composite plasmid respectively. DNA from pIP565 and composite plasmids and total   DNA from strain BM2000 were studied by agarose and polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis following digestion with restriction endonucleases, and by  Southern hybridization. These comparative analyses enabled us a) to show that  acquisition by pIP565 of resistance to all or some of the antibiotics was due to   the insertion of a single DNA fragment into the receptor plasmid; b) to detect  two types of composite plasmids with regard to the specificity of insertion into   pIP565 and the mapping of the inserts; c) to demonstrate that the ApCmSpSuTc  resistance determinants were integrated into S. ordonez BM2000 chromosomal DNA;  d) to map the restriction fragments of the translocatable sequence integrated  into strain BM2000 chromosome or into pIP565. The results obtained suggest that  two distinct mechanisms for the translocation of the R determinants coexist in S.  ordonez BM2000. Recombination between two of the four directly repeated copies of  the IS-like sequence (IS1522) present in S. ordonez chromosome leads to the  circularisation of all or part of the ApCmSpSuTc R determinants and is followed  by either 1) a second recombination with the copy of IS1522 in pIP565 (Type I  composite plasmids), or 2) transposition of precise groups of characters in  various sites of pIP565 (Type II composite plasmids).
