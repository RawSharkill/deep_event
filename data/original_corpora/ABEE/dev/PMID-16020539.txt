Emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to quinolones in Enterobacteriaceae. 

Although quinolone resistance results mostly from chromosomal mutations in  Enterobacteriaceae, it may also be mediated by plasmid-encoded Qnr determinants.   Qnr proteins protect DNA from quinolone binding and compromise the efficacy of  quinolones such as nalidixic acid. Qnr proteins (QnrA-like, QnrB and QnrS) have  been identified worldwide with a quite high prevalence among Asian isolates with   a frequent association with clavulanic acid inhibited expanded-spectrum  beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases. The qnrA genes are  embedded in complex sul1-type integrons. A very recent identification of the  origin of QnrA determinants in the water-borne species Shewanella algae  underlines the role of the environment as a reservoir for this emerging threat.  It may help to determine the location of in vivo transfer of qnrA genes. Further   analysis of the role (if any) of quinolones for enhancing this gene transfer may   be conducted. This could prevent the spread, if still possible, of this novel  antibiotic resistance mechanism.
