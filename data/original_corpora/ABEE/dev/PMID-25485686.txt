Lysocin E is a new antibiotic that targets menaquinone in the bacterial membrane. 

To obtain therapeutically effective new antibiotics, we first searched for  bacterial culture supernatants with antimicrobial activity in vitro and then  performed a secondary screening using the silkworm infection model. Through  further purification of the in vivo activity, we obtained a compound with a  previously uncharacterized structure and named it 'lysocin E'. Lysocin E  interacted with menaquinone in the bacterial membrane to achieve its potent  bactericidal activity, a mode of action distinct from that of any other known  antibiotic, indicating that lysocin E comprises a new class of antibiotic. This  is to our knowledge the first report of a direct interaction between a small  chemical compound and menaquinone that leads to bacterial killing. Furthermore,  lysocin E decreased the mortality of infected mice. To our knowledge, lysocin E  is the first compound identified and purified by quantitative measurement of  therapeutic effects in an invertebrate infection model that exhibits robust in  vivo effects in mammals.
