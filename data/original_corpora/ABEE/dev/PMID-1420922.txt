Study of mechanisms of electric field-induced DNA transfection. IV. Effects of  DNA topology on cell uptake and transfection efficiency.

Electric parameters and solvent conditions are known to influence the efficiency   of DNA transfection of cells by a pulsed electric field (PEF). A previous study  (Neumann, E., M. Schaefer-Ridder, Y. Wang, and P. H. Hofschneider. 1982. EMBO  (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1:841-845) has indicated that DNA topology is also an  important determinant. We report an investigation of the PEF induced uptake,  stability, and expression of three different topological isomers, circular  supercoiled (scDNA), circular relaxed (crDNA), and linearized (lnDNA) forms of  the plasmid pBR322, by Escherichia coli strain JM105. Monomeric pBR322 prepared  by the electroelution from an agarose gel was in the supercoiled form. Treatment   of the scDNA with wheat germ topoisomerase I removed the superhelicity and the  DNA assumed the relaxed circular form. Treatment of scDNA by a restriction  endonuclease, EcoRI or Hind III, linearized the DNA. The MgCl2-dependent bindings  of all three forms of DNA to the cell surface were indistinguishable. So was the   PEF induced cell uptake. In contrast, the transfection efficiency (TE) for the  scDNA and the crDNA were high (approximately 2 x 10(8) micrograms-1 DNA at  neutral pH), whereas that for the lnDNA was approximately five orders of  magnitude lower (less than 1 x 10(3) micrograms-1 DNA). Analysis by agarose gel  electrophoresis indicated that the PEF loaded ln DNA was degraded by the host  cell within 3 h. However, the loaded scDNA and the crDNA were stable and  expressed in the cytoplasm. We conclude that first, the PEF induced DNA entry  into E. coli did not depend on the topology of the DNA. As cellular uptake of DNA  also correlated with the surface binding, these data support electrophoresis of  surface bound DNA as the dominating mechanism for the DNA entry. Second, the  variations of TE for different topological forms of DNA reflected their relative   stability in the host cells. Third, since the loaded DNA could be either rapidly   degraded by the host enzyme or expressed, they were unlikely coated with a layer   of protective lipid membrane. Thus, PEF induced cellular uptake of DNA is  unlikely by the endocytotic mechanisms as was reported previously for the  liposomes (Chernomordik, L. V., A. V. Sokolov, and V. G. Budker. 1990.Biochim.  Biophys. Acta. 1024:179-183).
