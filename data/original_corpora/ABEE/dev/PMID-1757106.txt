Mechanisms involved in the evasion of the host defence by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an extracellular opportunistic pathogen, utilizes two  major mechanisms to evade the host defence system. One of these mechanisms is the  production of a large number of extracellular products, such as proteases,  toxins, and lipases. The two proteases, alkaline protease and elastase, inhibit  the function of the cells of the immune system (phagocytes, NK cells, T cells),  inactivate several cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IFN-r, TNF), cleave immunoglobulins and  inactivate complement. Inhibition of the local immune response by bacterial  proteases provides an environment for the colonization and establishment of  chronic infection. The other mechanism by which P. aeruginosa evades the host  defence system is the biofilm mode of growth of the bacteria in chronic  infections. The biofilm-grown bacteria induce a low phagocyte response, and  provide a barrier for the bacteria against antibodies, complement, and the cells   of the immune system. Protection from the host defence system combined with  increased antibiotic resistance of the bacteria in the biofilm are the major  reasons for the persistence of P. aeruginosa in chronic infections.
