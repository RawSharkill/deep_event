Virulence and drug resistance roles of multidrug efflux systems of Salmonella  enterica serovar Typhimurium. 

Drug efflux systems play a major role in resistance to a wide range of noxious  compounds in several Gram negative species. Here, we report the drug resistance  and virulence phenotypes of Salmonella mutants defective in either  resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type systems and/or in drug efflux systems  belonging to the major facilitator (MFS), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion   (MATE), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamilies. We determined that nine  potential drug transporters contribute to drug resistance of Salmonella and found  that the Salmonella-specific MdsABC system conferred resistance to a variety of  toxic compounds. The RND-type MdsAB system could function with either MdsC, which  is encoded in the same operon, or TolC as the outer membrane component. Although   the Salmonella EmrAB, MdfA and MdtK are 90% identical in their amino acid  sequences to their Escherichia coli homologues, the drug specificity of  Salmonella transporters was different from that reported for equivalent E. coli  transporters. Deletion of the macAB genes attenuated Salmonella virulence and a  strain lacking all drug efflux systems was avirulent when mice were inoculated by  the oral route. The promoter region of the macAB drug efflux system genes  harbours a binding site for the response regulator PhoP, which functions to  repress macAB transcription. The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is a major  regulator of Salmonella virulence, which underscores the connection between drug   efflux systems and virulence.
