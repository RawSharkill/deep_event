Resistance of highly branched (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans to formolysis.

Small molecular weight (MW) glucan derivatives could be a useful tool for  studying the mechanisms of beta-glucan mediated biological activity, especially  as antagonists for a beta-glucan receptor. This paper described the stability of   various (1-->6) branched (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans to formolysis in the preparation   of small MW derivatives. The glucans used were curdlan (linear), pachyman (few  branches), GRN (one branch in every third main chain unit; 2/6), SPG (2/6), SSG  (3/6), and OL-2 (4/6). Curdlan and pachyman were easily degraded to  oligosaccharides by degradation for 20 min at 100 degrees C by 90% formic acid.  However, branched glucans, especially the highly branched glucans, SSG and OL-2,   were significantly resistant to degradation, and the majority remained high MW.  SSG required a longer period and/or a higher temperature (121 degrees C  treatment) to produce small MW derivatives. Branched glucans were also resistant   to zymolyase (an endo-(1-->3)-beta-D-glucan hydrolase) digestion. These facts  suggest that the (1-->6)-beta-D-branched residues contribute to the glucans'  resistance to formic acid degradation and zymolyase digestion.
