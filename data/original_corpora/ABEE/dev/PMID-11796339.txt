SmeC, an outer membrane multidrug efflux protein of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 

A homologue of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,   smeABC, was cloned from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by using, as a probe, a PCR   product amplified from this organism with primers based on the mexB sequence. The  smeABC genes were hyperexpressed in a mutant strain displaying resistance to  several antimicrobials, including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and  fluoroquinolones. Deletions in smeC but not smeB compromised this resistance,  suggesting that SmeC contributed to the multidrug resistance of the mutant as  part of another, as-yet-unidentified multidrug efflux system. Consistent with  SmeC functioning independently of SmeAB, a promoter activity was identified  upstream of smeC. Upstream of the smeABC genes, a putative two-gene operon,  smeSR, encoding homologues of bacterial two-component regulatory systems was  identified. The cloned smeR gene activated expression of a smeA-lacZ fusion,  indicating that SmeR positively regulates expression of the smeABC genes.  Consistent with this, the multidrug resistance of the SmeABC-hyperexpressing  mutant was compromised by deletion of smeR. Intriguingly, SmeC expression in S.  maltophilia paralleled a beta-lactamase activity provided by a C-terminally  truncated L2 enzyme, which was apparently responsible for the beta-lactam  resistance of the SmeABC-hyperexpressing mutant. This represents the first report  of coregulation of an efflux resistance determinant and a beta-lactamase.
