Molecular cloning and transcriptional regulation of ompT, a ToxR-repressed gene  in Vibrio cholerae. 

In pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, at least 17 genes are co-ordinately regulated by  ToxR. Most of these genes, including those that encode cholera toxin (CT), toxin   co-regulated pilus (TCP), accessory colonization factor (ACF) and OmpU, are  positively regulated. OmpT is the only identified protein under negative  regulation of ToxR. To understand the molecular mechanism by which ToxR represses  OmpT expression, we cloned ompT and characterized the ompT promoter and its  interaction with ToxR. Sequence analysis revealed that ompT encodes a predicted  35.8 kDa outer membrane porin of V. cholerae. Primer extension analysis  identified a transcriptional start site 104 bp upstream of the translational  start codon. Both primer extension analysis and promoter fusion studies showed  that ToxR represses OmpT expression at the transcriptional level. Promoter fusion  studies also suggest that cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is involved in ompT  activation. Gel mobility shift assays combined with DNase I footprinting analysis  demonstrated that ToxR mediates repression of ompT transcription by directly  binding to an A/T-rich region between -95 and -30 of the ompT promoter. To  further understand how the interaction of ToxR with different promoters results  in its function as an activator or repressor, we have also mapped the regions on   the ctxAB and toxT promoters to which ToxR binds. The regions protected by ToxR  on each of these promoters are all A/T rich and large in size, although they are   positioned differently relative to each transcriptional start site.
