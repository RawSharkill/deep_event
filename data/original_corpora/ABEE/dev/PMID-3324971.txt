Testing for bacterial resistance to arsenic in monitoring well water by the  direct viable counting method.

Direct viable counting of metal-resistant bacteria (DVCMR) has been found to be  useful in both enumerating and differentiating metal-resistant and  metal-sensitive strains of bacteria. The DVCMR bioassay was used to detect  effects of low and high concentrations of arsenic and arsenicals on bacterial  populations in groundwater. The level of resistance of the bacterial populations   to arsenate was determined by the DVCMR bioassay, and the results showed a linear  correlation with the total arsenic concentrations in the monitoring well water  samples; no correlation was observed by culture methods with the methods  employed. Bacteria resistant to 2,000 micrograms of arsenate per ml were isolated  from all monitoring well water samples studied. Strains showed similar antibiotic  and heavy-metal profiles, suggesting that the arsenic was not a highly selective   pressure for arsenic alone. The monitoring well water samples were amended with  arsenate and nutrients to determine the biotransformation mechanisms involved.  Preliminary results suggest that bacteria indigenous to the monitoring well water  samples did not directly transform, i.e., precipitate or volatilize, dissolved  arsenic. It was concluded that arsenic contamination of the groundwater can be  monitored by the DVCMR bioassay.
