Transition to the open state of the TolC periplasmic tunnel entrance. 

The TolC channel-tunnel spans the bacterial outer membrane and periplasm,  providing a large exit duct for protein export and multidrug efflux when  recruited by substrate-engaged inner membrane complexes. The sole constriction in  the single pore of the homotrimeric TolC is the periplasmic tunnel entrance,  which in its resting configuration is closed by dense packing of the 12  tunnel-forming alpha-helices. Recruitment of TolC must trigger opening for  substrate transit to occur, but the mechanism underlying transition from the  closed to the open state is not known. The high resolution structure of TolC  indicates that the tunnel helices are constrained at the entrance by a circular  network of intra- and intermonomer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. To assess how  opening is achieved, we disrupted these connections and monitored changes in the   aperture size by measuring the single channel conductance of TolC derivatives in   black lipid bilayers. Elimination of individual connections caused incremental  weakening of the circular network, accompanied by gradual relaxation from the  closed state and increased flexibility of the entrance. Simultaneous abolition of  the key links caused a substantial increase in conductance, generating an  aperture that corresponds to the modeled open state, with the capacity to allow  access and passage of diverse substrates. The results support a model in which  transition to the open state of TolC is achieved by an iris-like realignment of  the tunnel entrance helices.
