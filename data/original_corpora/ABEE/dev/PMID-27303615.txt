Association of hp1181 and hp1184 Genes With the Active Efflux Phenotype in  Multidrug-Resistant Isolates of Helicobacter pylori. 

BACKGROUND: During the last decades the rate of multidrug resistance among  clinical Helicobacter pylori isolates has increased. Active pumping out of the  drugs may be an important mechanism for multidrug resistance in H. pylori  strains. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of two  H. pylori efflux-genes, hp1181 and hp1184 with the active-efflux phenotype in MDR  clinical-strains of H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimal inhibitory  concentration (MIC) and drug accumulation for beta-lactames, Tetracycline (TET),   Erythromycin (ERY), Metronidazole (MTZ), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Ethidium Bromide  (EtBr) was performed in the presence and absence of carbonyl cyanide  M-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone (CCCP). Presence of hp1181 and hp1184 genes was detected  by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RT-PCR was performed to compare  expression of efflux genes by MDR strains, demonstrating active efflux with the  strains without active efflux. RESULTS: Two- to four-fold decrease in minimum  inhibitory concentration (MIC) and two-fold increase in accumulation were  observed for EtBr in the presence of CCCP for 67% (8) of 12 MDR strains. With  CCCP, two- to four-fold decrease in MIC and 1.4- to 1.8-fold increase in the  accumulation of beta-lactames, TET, CIP and MTZ were obtained for 42% (5) of the   MDR strains. Six, five and three of the 12 MDR strains amplified hp1184, hp1181,   and both of them, respectively. The RT-PCR product for expression of hp1181 by  MDR strains was approximately 100 bp shorter than that of the 26695 susceptible  standard strain. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the genes hp1184 and hp1181 are  associated with the specific active efflux of EtBr and non-related antibiotics,  respectively. For displaying these phenotypes, a post-transcriptional regulation   step may be required.
