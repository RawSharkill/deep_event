Molecular and biochemical characterization of a carbapenem hydrolysing  beta-lactamase from Flavobacterium johnsoniae. 

Flavobacterium johnsoniae CIP100931 is resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics   and has a decreased susceptibility to carbapenems. A beta-lactamase gene was  cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B. The purified beta-lactamase,  JOHN-1, with a pI value of 9.0 and with a determined relative molecular mass of  approximately 27 kDa was found to be a monomeric zinc-dependent enzyme that  hydrolyses penicillins, narrow- and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins,  carbapenems, but not monobactams. Sequence analysis revealed that JOHN-1 is a  molecular class B beta-lactamase that is most closely related to BlaB from  Chryseobacterium meningosepticum and IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes (47%  and 41% amino acid identity, respectively). JOHN-1 is a new member of the highly   divergent subclass B1 lineage of metallo-enzymes. Although F. johnsoniae and  Chryseobacterium spp. are phylogenetically related bacteria, this report further   underlines the heterogeneity of class B beta-lactamases that are naturally  produced by environmental Gram-negative aerobes and that are now recognized as  the most important reservoir for these beta-lactamase genes.
