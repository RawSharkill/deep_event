EmrE, a model for studying evolution and mechanism of ion-coupled transporters. 

EmrE is a small (110 residues) SMR transporter from Escherichia coli that  extrudes positively charged aromatic drugs in exchange for two protons, thus  rendering bacteria resistant to a variety of toxic compounds. Due to its size,  stability and retention of its function upon solubilization in detergent, EmrE  provides a unique experimental paradigm for the biochemical and biophysical  studies of membrane based ion-coupled transporters. In addition, EmrE has been in  center stage in the past two years because it provides also a paradigm for the  study of the evolution of membrane proteins. Controversy around this topic is  still going on and some novel concepts are surfacing that may contribute to our  understanding of evolution of topology of membrane proteins. Furthermore, based  on the findings that the cell multidrug transporters interact functionally we  introduce the concept of a cell Resistosome.
