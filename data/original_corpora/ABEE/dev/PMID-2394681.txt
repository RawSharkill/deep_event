Transformation of Rochalimaea quintana, a member of the family Rickettsiaceae.

Rochalimaea quintana is the only member of the family Rickettsiaceae that can be   grown in vitro. Because of its relationship to the other members of this family,   techniques developed to transform R. quintana might be applicable to the obligate  intracellular bacteria of the Rickettsiaceae. These procedures are critical to  understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis and the nature of obligate intracellular  growth. A transformation procedure for R. quintana has been established by using   electroporation techniques. Several cosmids or plasmids with replicons RK2 and  RSF1010 have been successfully used to transform this organism. Transformants  were obtained by selection for antibiotic resistance to chloramphenicol or  kanamycin. Plasmid retention and replication has been verified by Southern blot  analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Experimentation with  different voltage field strengths and pulse times indicate that 12.5 kV/cm at 10   ms (25 microF and 400 omega) was optimal, giving a transformation frequency of  approximately 0.3% and 3 x 10(5) transformants per microgram of DNA.
