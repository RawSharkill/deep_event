Effect of plasmid RP1 on phase changes in inner and outer membranes and  lipopolysaccharide from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: a Fourier transform infrared  study.

The successful transfer of the resistance plasmid RP1 into the Gram-negative  bacterium Acinetobacter calcoaceticus resulted in increased resistance of this  microorganism to the antibiotics kanamycin and tetracycline. Microorganisms  harboring the RP1 plasmid showed altered fatty acid composition in the  lipopolysaccharide fraction and increased outer membrane permeability compared to  organisms without the plasmid. Thermotropic gel to liquid crystal lipid phase  changes were detected in both inner and outer membranes and purified  lipopolysaccharide by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The phase  transition temperatures observed in the outer membranes and isolated  lipopolysaccharide of the plasmid-containing cells were significantly higher than  those of the plasmid-free organisms, while little difference was observed for the  inner membranes. The plasmid-induced decrease in outer membrane fluidity may play  a mediating role in the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and susceptibility to  host immune cells in Gram-negative microorganisms.
