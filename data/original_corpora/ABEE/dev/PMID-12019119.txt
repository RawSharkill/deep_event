Molecular characterization of the vanE gene cluster in vancomycin resistant  Enterococcus faecalis N00-410 isolated in Canada. 

The vanE operon was characterized from Enterococcus faecalis N00-410 (MIC of  vancomycin = 24 microg/ml). The organization of the vanE operon was identical to   that of the vanC1 operon from Enterococcus gallinarum, with protein identities  ranging from 46 to 63%. An open reading frame located downstream of the vanE  operon showed significant homology to a number of integrase genes, all of which  are located downstream of the chromosomal GMP synthase gene guaA.
