A family of extracytoplasmic proteins that allow transport of large molecules  across the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. 

Seventeen fully sequenced and two partially sequenced extracytoplasmic proteins  of purple, gram-negative bacteria constitute a homologous family termed the  putative membrane fusion protein (MFP) family. Each such protein apparently  functions in conjunction with a cytoplasmic membrane transporter of the  ATP-binding cassette family, major facilitator superfamily, or heavy metal  resistance/nodulation/cell division family to facilitate transport of proteins,  peptides, drugs, or carbohydrates across the two membranes of the gram-negative  bacterial cell envelope. Evidence suggests that at least some of these transport   systems also function in conjunction with a distinct outer membrane protein. We  report here that the phylogenies of these proteins correlate with the types of  transport systems with which they function as well as with the natures of the  substrates transported. Characterization of the MFPs with respect to secondary  structure, average hydropathy, and average similarity provides circumstantial  evidence as to how they may allow localized fusion of the two gram-negative  bacterial cell membranes. The membrane fusion protein of simian virus 5 is shown   to exhibit significant sequence similarity to representative bacterial MFPs.
