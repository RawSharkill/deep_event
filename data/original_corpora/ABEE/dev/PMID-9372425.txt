Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ. 

We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial  isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated  from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR  products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven   of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five  Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight  (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while  eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This  is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except  one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ   gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides   fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus  faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast,  tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates   of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate  of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay  was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate  and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had  one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in   screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
