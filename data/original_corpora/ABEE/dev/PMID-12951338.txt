Beta-lactam resistance modulated by the overexpression of response regulators of   two-component signal transduction systems in Escherichia coli. 

OBJECTIVES: In Escherichia coli, there are 32 open reading frames assumed, on the  basis of sequence similarities, to be response regulator genes of two-component  signal transduction systems. We cloned all 32 response regulators and examined  whether or not response regulator-overexpressing cells confer resistance to  beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli. METHODS: E. coli KAM3 (acrB), a  drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host strain for the overproduction of  response regulators. MICs were determined by the agar dilution method. RESULTS:  Thirteen response regulators out of 32 genes, namely baeR, cheY, cpxR, creB,  evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred increased  beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB and dcuR  conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance is due to  up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and mdtABC for   baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance was  completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated  cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC  deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Two-component  signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam resistance in E. coli.  Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal transduction  system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.
