Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus norA gene,   which confers resistance to quinolones. 

The norA gene cloned from chromosomal DNA of quinolone resistant Staphylococcus  aureus TK2566 conferred relatively high resistance to hydrophilic quinolones such  as norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, but only low or no  resistance at all to hydrophobic ones such as nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, and   sparfloxacin in S. aureus and Escherichia coli. The 2.7-kb DNA fragment  containing the norA gene had a long open reading frame coding for 388 amino acid   residues with a molecular weight of 42,265, which was consistent with the  experimental value of about 49,000 obtained on DNA-directed translation. The  deduced NorA polypeptide has 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions and is  partly homologous to tetracycline resistance protein and sugar transport  proteins. The uptake of a hydrophilic quinolone, enoxacin, by S. aureus harboring  a plasmid carrying the norA gene was about 50% that by the parent strain lacking   the plasmid, but it increased to almost the same level as that by the latter  strain with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. On the other hand, the  uptake of a hydrophobic quinolone, sparfloxacin, was similar in the two strains.   These results suggest that the NorA polypeptide may constitute a  membrane-associated active efflux pump of hydrophilic quinolones.
