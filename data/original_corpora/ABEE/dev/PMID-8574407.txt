The tellurite resistance determinants tehAtehB and klaAklaBtelB have different  biochemical requirements.

The tehAtehB operon from the Escherichia coli chromosome (32.3 min) mediates  resistance to potassium tellurite (K2TeO3) when expressed on a multicopy plasmid   such as pUC8 (pTWT100). An MIC of 128 micrograms ml-1 is observed when tehAtehB  is expressed in a wild-type host and grown on rich media. In this study, the  tehAtehB determinant was transformed into mutants deficient in electron transport  processes and/or thiol redox coupling within E. coli. These mutants included ubi,  nad, cys, nar, trx, grx, gsh and sod. MICs of tehAtehB transformed into these  mutants ranged from 1-16 micrograms K2TeO3 ml-1 compared to 0.03-2 micrograms  ml-1 for strains transformed with a control plasmid. The tellurite resistance  determinant locus kilA cloned from the IncP alpha plasmid RK2Ter (pDT1558) was  also investigated in these strains. This tellurite resistance determinant showed   little or no dependency on the host genotype. The ability of tehAtehB to mediate   resistance in wild-type hosts is limited to rich medium. Rich medium may provide   a key unidentified cofactor required by TehATehB that is not provided under  minimal conditions. Again, the ability of the kilA determinant to mediate  tellurite resistance was independent of medium conditions. These data suggest  that either a reducing environment or electron-reducing equivalents are required   for tehAtehB to mediate high levels of resistance to potassium tellurite.  Therefore, the two resistance determinants studied here possess two very  different biochemical mechanisms of resistance. Our data also suggest a mechanism  for endogenous resistance to tellurite which involves nitrate reductase,  superoxide dismutase, and thiol redox processes.
