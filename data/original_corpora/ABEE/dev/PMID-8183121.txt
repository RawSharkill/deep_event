[Physiologic and physico-chemical mechanisms of the resistance of microorganisms   to freezing and drying].

The influence of osmotic stress and temperature on physiologo-biochemical state  of microbial cells intended for freeze-drying has been analysed. Molecular  mechanisms of cryo- and xeroprotective effect of protectors are dealt with in the  paper.
