[Bacteriological aspects of extrarespiratory tuberculosis].

775 strains of extrapulmonary tubercle bacilli isolated during four years  (1968-1972) were studied. Our results enabled us to confirm the paucibacillary  nature of these tuberculous sites and the variety of their resistance to  antibiotics. The comparison between the levels and types of primary resistance in  pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis enabled us to better understand the  transmission mechanisms of the tubercle bacilli in the community and its progress  in the infected organism.
