Mechanisms of transcription activation exerted by GadX and GadW at the gadA and  gadBC gene promoters of the glutamate-based acid resistance system in Escherichia  coli. 

In Escherichia coli the gad system protects the cell from the extreme acid stress  encountered during transit through the host stomach. The structural genes gadA,  gadB, and gadC encode two glutamate decarboxylase isoforms and a  glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) antiporter, respectively. Glutamate  decarboxylation involves both proton consumption and production of GABA, a  neutral compound which is finally exported via the GadC antiporter. Regulation of  gadA and gadBC transcription is very complex, involving several circuits  controlling expression under different growth phase, medium, and pH conditions.  In this study we found that the AraC-like activators GadX and GadW share the same  44-bp binding sites in the gadA and gadBC regulatory regions. The common binding   sites are centered at 110.5 bp and 220.5 bp upstream of the transcriptional start  points of the gadA and gadBC genes, respectively. At the gadA promoter this  regulatory element overlaps one of the binding sites of the repressor H-NS. The  DNA of the gadBC promoter has an intrinsic bend which is centered at position  -121. These findings, combined with transcriptional regulation studies, may  account for the two different mechanisms of transcriptional activation by GadX  and GadW at the two promoters studied. We speculate that while at the gadA  promoter GadX and GadW activate transcription by displacing H-NS via an  antirepressor mechanism, at the gadBC promoter the mechanism of activation  involves looping of the DNA sequence between the promoter and the activator  binding site.
