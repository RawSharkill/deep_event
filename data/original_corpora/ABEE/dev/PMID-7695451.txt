[Mechanism of action of the antineoplastic antibiotic asterin on cellular factors  of immunogenesis regulation].

Asterin is a novel antitumor antibiotic isolated from a medicinal plant of the  aster family in the Department of Antibiotics of the Institute of Microbiology  and Virology of the National Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine. The mechanisms  of its influence on the host antitumor resistance were studied. Asterin was shown  to promote the modulation of the specific and nonspecific link of the antitumor  resistance. It activated to a definite extent the effector productive phase with   the dominating influence on the proliferative phase. The antibiotic  immunocorrective action was achieved via the recovery of the suppression  mechanism controlling the proliferation and differentiation of all the cell  populations. The molecular mechanisms of the asterin action on the lymphocyte  transformation characterized by an increase in the metabolism and synthesis of  the membrane phospholipids are likely associated with the control of their free  radical processes.
