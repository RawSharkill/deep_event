[Pathogenic mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic suppurative otitis  media].

The increased frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in suppurative chronic otitis  media makes this bacillus interesting. We consider the biological pathogenic and   biochemical mechanisms, as well as some aspects of the interaction between PA and  antibiotic therapy.
