Role of porin proteins OmpF and OmpC in the permeation of beta-lactams. 

Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 lacking major outer membrane proteins were  obtained by selecting for resistance to the beta-lactam cefoxitin. Three classes   of resistant strains were found: mutants in ompB, a regulatory locus for proteins  OmpF and OmpC; mutants in ompF; and one mutant in tpo. The OmpF and OmpC proteins  facilitate penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membrane.
