Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding penicillin binding proteins in   beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant Haemophilus influenzae in Japan. 

OBJECTIVE: beta-Lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant Haemophilus influenzae is  a common opportunistic pathogen of hospital- and community-acquired infections,  harboring multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ftsI gene, which codes   for penicillin binding protein-3. The objectives of this study were to perform  comprehensive genetic analyses of whole regions of the penicillin binding  proteins in H. influenzae and to identify additional single nucleotide  polymorphisms related to antibiotic resistance, especially to ampicillin and  other cephalosporins. RESULTS: In this genome analysis of the ftsI gene in 27  strains of H. influenzae, 10 of 23 (43.5%) specimens of group III genotype  beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant H. influenzae were paradoxically  classified as ampicillin sensitive phenotypes. Unfortunately, we could not  identify any novel mutations that were significantly associated with ampicillin  minimum inhibitory concentrations in other regions of the penicillin binding  proteins, and we reconfirmed that susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was  mainly defined by previously reported SNPs in the ftsI gene. We should also  consider detailed changes in expression that lead to antibiotic resistance in the  future because the acquisition of resistance to antimicrobials can be predicted  by the expression levels of a small number of genes.
