Overlap of replication rounds disturbs the progression of replicating forks in a   ribonucleotide reductase mutant of Escherichia coli. 

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the only enzyme specifically required for the  synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). Surprisingly, Escherichia coli cells  carrying the nrdA101 allele, which codes for a thermosensitive RNR101, are able  to replicate entire chromosomes at 42 degrees C under RNA or protein synthesis  inhibition. Here we show that the RNR101 protein is unstable at 42 degrees C and   that its degradation under restrictive conditions is prevented by the presence of  rifampicin. Nevertheless, the mere stability of the RNR protein at 42 degrees C  cannot explain the completion of chromosomal DNA replication in the nrdA101  mutant. We found that inactivation of the DnaA protein by using several dnaAts  alleles allows complete chromosome replication in the absence of rifampicin and  suppresses the nucleoid segregation and cell division defects observed in the  nrdA101 mutant at 42 degrees C. As both inactivation of the DnaA protein and  inhibition of RNA synthesis block the occurrence of new DNA initiations, the  consequent decrease in the number of forks per chromosome could be related to  those effects. In support of this notion, we found that avoiding multifork  replication rounds by the presence of moderate extra copies of datA sequence  increases the relative amount of DNA synthesis of the nrdA101 mutant at 42  degrees C. We propose that a lower replication fork density results in an  improvement of the progression of DNA replication, allowing replication of the  entire chromosome at the restrictive temperature. The mechanism related to this  effect is also discussed.
