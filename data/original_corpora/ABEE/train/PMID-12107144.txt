Genomic and functional analyses of SXT, an integrating antibiotic resistance gene  transfer element derived from Vibrio cholerae. 

SXT is representative of a family of conjugative-transposon-like mobile genetic  elements that encode multiple antibiotic resistance genes. In recent years,  SXT-related conjugative, self-transmissible integrating elements have become  widespread in Asian Vibrio cholerae. We have determined the 100-kb DNA sequence  of SXT. This element appears to be a chimera composed of transposon-associated  antibiotic resistance genes linked to a variety of plasmid- and phage-related  genes, as well as to many genes from unknown sources. We constructed a nearly  comprehensive set of deletions through the use of the one-step chromosomal gene  inactivation technique to identify SXT genes involved in conjugative transfer and  chromosomal excision. SXT, unlike other conjugative transposons, utilizes a  conjugation system related to that encoded by the F plasmid. More than half of  the SXT genome, including the composite transposon-like structure that contains  its antibiotic resistance genes, was not required for its mobility. Two SXT loci,  designated setC and setD, whose predicted amino acid sequences were similar to  those of the flagellar regulators FlhC and FlhD, were found to encode regulators   that activate the transcription of genes required for SXT excision and transfer.   Another locus, designated setR, whose gene product bears similarity to lambdoid  phage CI repressors, also appears to regulate SXT gene expression.
