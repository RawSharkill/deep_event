The role of the TolC family in protein transport and multidrug efflux. From  stereochemical certainty to mechanistic hypothesis. 

Gram-negative bacteria are enveloped by a system of two membranes, and they use  specialized multicomponent, energy-driven pumps to transport molecules directly  across this double-layered partition from the cell interior to the extra-cellular  environment. One component of these pumps is embedded in the outer-membrane, and   the paradigm for its structure and function is the TolC protein from Escherichia   coli. A common component of a wide variety of efflux pumps, TolC and its  homologues are involved in the export of chemically diverse molecules ranging  from large protein toxins, such as alpha-hemolysin, to small toxic compounds,  such as antibiotics. TolC family members thus play important roles in conferring   pathogenic bacteria with both virulence and multidrug resistance. These pumps  assemble reversibly in a transient process that brings together TolC or its  homologue, an inner-membrane-associated periplasmic component, an integral  inner-membrane translocase and the substrate itself. TolC can associate in this  fashion with a variety of different partners to participate in the transport of  diverse substrates. We review here the structure and function of TolC and the  other components of the efflux/transport pump.
