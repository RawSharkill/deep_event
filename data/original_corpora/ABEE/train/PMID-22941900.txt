TetAB46, a predicted heterodimeric ABC transporter conferring tetracycline  resistance in Streptococcus australis isolated from the oral cavity. 

OBJECTIVES: To identify the genes responsible for tetracycline resistance in a  strain of Streptococcus australis isolated from pooled saliva from healthy  volunteers in France. S. australis is a viridans Streptococcus, originally  isolated from the oral cavity of children in Australia, and subsequently reported  in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and as a cause of invasive disease in an  elderly patient. METHODS: Agar containing 2 mg/L tetracycline was used for the  isolation of tetracycline-resistant organisms. A genomic library in Escherichia  coli was used to isolate the tetracycline resistance determinant. In-frame  deletions and chromosomal repair were used to confirm function. Antibiotic  susceptibility was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion assay. RESULTS:  The tetracycline resistance determinant from S. australis FRStet12 was isolated  from a genomic library in E. coli and DNA sequencing showed two open reading  frames predicted to encode proteins with similarity to multidrug resistance-type   ABC transporters. Both genes were required for tetracycline resistance (to both  the naturally occurring and semi-synthetic tetracyclines) and they were  designated tetAB(46). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a predicted ABC  transporter conferring tetracycline resistance in a member of the oral  microbiota.
