Effect of human saliva on the fluoride sensitivity of glucose uptake by  Streptococcus mutans.

The fluoride (F) sensitivity of glucose uptake by whole cell suspensions of  streptococcus mutans in the presence and absence of human whole salivary  supernatant was studied. It was observed that dithiothreitol (DTT) and other  thiols markedly reduced the F sensitivity of cells when saliva (50%, vol/vol) was  present during glucose uptake. In the absence of saliva, cells were sensitive to   2 to 2.5 mM F regardless of the presence of thiols. Supplementation of cells in  phosphate or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffers with  physiological concentrations of calcium or phosphate had no effect on the F  sensitivity of the organism. Experiments with permeabilized cells suggested that   thiols themselves had no direct effect on the F sensitivity of enolase (a  principal F target). Cells pretreated with DDT subsequently exhibited decreased F  sensitivity when examined in the presence of saliva but not in the absence of  saliva. Cells pretreated with whole salivary supernatant were found to be  subsequently less sensitive to F in the absence of saliva during glucose uptake.   Furthermore, in cases where cells were pretreated with saliva, subsequent  additions of DDT were unnecessary to obtain maximal reduction in the F  sensitivity of glucose uptake. It was concluded that the saliva-dependent  reduction in F sensitivity of glucose uptake was not due to sequestration of  available F by salivary constituents. The data suggest that a salivary  component(s) interacts directly with the microorganism in some manner which  results in reduced F sensitivity of the process under study. Possible mechanisms   of saliva action are discussed.
