Detection of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type XI carrying highly  divergent mecA, mecI, mecR1, blaZ, and ccr genes in human clinical isolates of  clonal complex 130 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 

Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is mediated by penicillin binding protein  2a (PBP 2a), encoded by mecA on mobile staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec  (SCCmec) elements. In this study, two clonal complex 130 (CC130)  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from patients in  Irish hospitals were identified that were phenotypically PBP 2a positive but  lacked mecA by conventional PCR and by DNA microarray screening. The isolates  were identified as methicillin susceptible S. aureus using the GeneXpert  real-time PCR assay. Whole-genome sequencing of one isolate (M10/0061) revealed a  30-kb SCCmec element encoding a class E mec complex with highly divergent  blaZ-mecA-mecR1-mecI, a type 8 cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) complex  consisting of ccrA1-ccrB3, an arsenic resistance operon, and flanking direct  repeats (DRs). The SCCmec element was almost identical to that of SCCmec type XI   (SCCmec XI) identified by the Sanger Institute in sequence type 425 bovine MRSA  strain LGA251 listed on the website of the International Working Group on the  Classification of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Elements. The open reading  frames (ORFs) identified within SCCmec XI of M10/0061 exhibited 21 to 93% amino  acid identity to ORFs in GenBank. A third DR was identified ca. 3 kb downstream  of SCCmec XI, indicating the presence of a possible SCC remnant. SCCmec XI was  also identified in the second CC130 MRSA isolate by PCR and sequencing. The CC130  MRSA isolates may be of animal origin as previously reported CC130 S. aureus  strains were predominantly from bovine sources. The highly divergent nature of  SCCmec XI relative to other SCCmec elements indicates that it may have originated  in another taxon.
