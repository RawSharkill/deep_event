Insertion sequence ISEcp1B is involved in expression and mobilization of a  bla(CTX-M) beta-lactamase gene. 

The genetic structures (ca. 10-kb DNA fragment) surrounding the plasmid-borne  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase bla(CTX-M-19) gene in a Klebsiella pneumoniae  clinical isolate were determined. This beta-lactamase gene was part of a 4,797-bp  transposon inserted inside orf1 of Tn1721. Inside this transposon, bla(CTX-M-19)   was bracketed upstream and downstream by insertion sequences ISE cp1B and IS903D,  respectively, and further downstream by a truncated gene encoding an outer  membrane protein for iron transport. The single-copy ISEcp1B element was probably  involved alone in the mobilization process that led to a 5-bp duplication at the   target site of the transposed fragment. This mobilization event probably involved  one inverted repeat of ISE cp1B and a second sequence farther away, resembling  its second inverted repeat. Additionally, ISEcp1B provided -35 and -10 promoter  sequences, contributing to the high-level expression of the bla(CTX-M-19) gene.  Southern blot analysis failed to identify a reservoir of ISEcp1-like sequences  among a series of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species usually found  in the skin and intestinal human floras. The ability of ISEcp1-like elements to  mobilize and to promote the expression of beta-lactamase genes may explain, in  part, the current spread of CTX-M-type enzymes worldwide.
