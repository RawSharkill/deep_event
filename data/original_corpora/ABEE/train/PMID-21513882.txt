Sequential mechanism of assembly of multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC. 

Multidrug efflux pumps adversely affect both the clinical effectiveness of  existing antibiotics and the discovery process to find new ones. In this study,  we reconstituted and characterized by surface plasmon resonance the assembly of  AcrAB-TolC, the archetypal multidrug efflux pump from Escherichia coli. We report  that the periplasmic AcrA and the outer membrane channel TolC assemble  high-affinity complexes with AcrB transporter independently from each other.  Antibiotic novobiocin and MC-207,110 inhibitor bind to the immobilized AcrB but  do not affect interactions between components of the complex. In contrast, DARPin  inhibits interactions between AcrA and AcrB. Mutational opening of TolC channel  decreases stability of interactions and promotes disassembly of the complex. The   conformation of the membrane proximal domain of AcrA is critical for the  formation of AcrAB-TolC and could be targeted for the development of new  inhibitors.
