Breakage--reunion and copy choice mechanisms of recombination between short  homologous sequences.

To study recombination between short homologous sequences in Escherichia coli we   constructed plasmids composed of the pBR322 replicon, M13 replication origin and   a recombination unit inserted within and inactivating a gene encoding  chloramphenicol resistance. The unit was composed of short direct repeats (9, 18   or 27 bp) which flanked inverted repeats (0, 8 or 308 bp) and a gene encoding  kanamycin resistance. Recombination between direct repeats restored a functional   chloramphenicol resistance gene, and could be detected by a simple phenotype  test. The plasmids replicated in a double-stranded form, using the pBR322  replicon, and generated single-stranded DNA when the M13 replication origin was  activated. The frequency of chloramphenicol-resistant cells was low  (10(-8)-10(-4] when no single-stranded DNA was synthesized but increased greatly   (to 100%) after induction of single-stranded DNA synthesis. Recombination between  9 bp direct repeats entailed no transfer of DNA from parental to recombinant  plasmids, whereas recombination between 18 or 27 bp repeats entailed massive  transfer. The presence or length of inverted repeats did not alter the pattern of  DNA transfer. From these results we propose that direct repeats of 9 bp recombine  by a copy choice process, while those greater than or equal to 18 bp can  recombine by a breakage-reunion process. Genome rearrangements detected in many  organisms often occur by recombination between sequences less than 18 bp, which  suggests that they may result from copy choice recombination.
