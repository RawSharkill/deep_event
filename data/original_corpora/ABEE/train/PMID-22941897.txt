The newly described mecA homologue, mecALGA251, is present in  methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a diverse range of host  species. 

OBJECTIVES: A previously unidentified mecA homologue, mecA(LGA251), has recently   been described in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from humans   and dairy cattle. The origin and epidemiology of this novel homologue are  unclear. The objective of this study was to provide basic descriptive information  of MRSA isolates harbouring mecA(LGA251) from a range of host animal species.  METHODS: A number of S. aureus isolates from historical animal isolate  collections were chosen for investigation based on their similarity to known  mecA(LGA251) MRSA isolates. The presence of mecA(LGA251) was determined using a  multiplex PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by disc  diffusion. RESULTS: MRSA harbouring mecA(LGA251) were found in isolates from a  domestic dog, brown rats, a rabbit, a common seal, sheep and a chaffinch. All of   the isolates were phenotypically MRSA, although this depended on which test was  used; some isolates would be considered susceptible with certain assays. All  isolates were susceptible to linezolid, rifampicin, kanamycin, norfloxacin,  erythromycin, clindamycin, fusidic acid, tetracycline,  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and mupirocin. Five multilocus sequence types were   represented (2273, 130, 425, 1764 and 1245) and six spa types (t208, t6293, t742,  t6594, t7914 and t843). CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of MRSA isolates possessing  mecA(LGA251) from a diverse range of host species, including different taxonomic   classes, has important implications for the diagnosis of MRSA in these species  and our understanding of the epidemiology of this novel mecA homologue.
