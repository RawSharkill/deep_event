Molecular analysis and nucleotide sequence of the envCD operon of Escherichia  coli. 

The chromosomal DNA insert in plasmid pJK131, which complements the phenotypic  defects associated with a mutation in the envC gene of Escherichia coli strain  PM61, was sequenced. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed two open  reading frames (ORFs) coding for the proteins EnvC (41,281 daltons) and EnvD  (104,415 daltons). The envC gene product is synthesized as a pre-protein and,  after cleavage of a signal peptide, the mature protein is incorporated into the  cytoplasmic membrane. The detection of a common transcript for both ORFs  indicated the existence of an envCD operon. Deletion analysis and the generation   of frameshifts demonstrated that simultaneous expression of both genes is  required to complement the defects in strain PM61. Overproduction of EnvC protein  appears to be lethal to Escherichia coli. The envD gene, however, could be cloned  and expressed at high levels under control of the tac promoter without  deleterious effects on the host.
