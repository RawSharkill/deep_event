Molecular characterization of a carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from  Chryseobacterium (Flavobacterium) indologenes. 

Chryseobacterium (Flavobacterium) indologenes 001 clinical strain was resistant  to several beta-lactam classes including carbapenems. Shotgun cloning experiments  of Sau3AI restricted genomic DNA of C. indologenes 001 into pBKCMV cloning vector  followed by transformation into Escherichia coli DH10B gave one recombinant  plasmid possessing a 4.2-kb DNA insert. It encoded a pI 7.2 beta-lactamase of 239  amino acids (IND-1) which is a metallo-enzyme with a broad spectrum beta-lactam  hydrolysis profile. This class B carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamase shares the  highest identity (43%) with BlaB from C. meningosepticum, thus showing  heterogeneity of carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamases in Chryseobacterium spp.
