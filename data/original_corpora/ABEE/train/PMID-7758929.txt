Interaction of the chromosomal Tn 551 with two thermosensitive derivatives, pS1  and p delta D, of the plasmid pI9789 in Staphylococcus aureus.

The plasmid pI9789::Tn552 carries genes conferring resistance to penicillins and   to cadmium, mercury and arsenate ions. The presence of Tn551 at one location in  the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus enhances the frequency of suppression of   thermosensitivity of replication of the plasmids pS1 and p delta D which are  derivatives of pI9789::Tn552. Bacteriophage propagated on the bacteria in which  thermosensitivity of replication had been suppressed was used to transduce  cadmium resistance to S. aureus PS80N. The cadmium resistant transductants  obtained carried plasmid pS1 or p delta D with a copy of Tn551 inserted into a  specific site on pS1 but into several different sites on p delta D. The possible   mechanisms of the suppression are discussed.
