Structural and functional characterization of VanG D-Ala:D-Ser ligase associated   with vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. 

d-Alanyl:d-lactate (d-Ala:d-Lac) and d-alanyl:d-serine ligases are key enzymes in  vancomycin resistance of Gram-positive cocci. They catalyze a critical step in  the synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors that are low binding affinity   targets for vancomycin. The structure of the d-Ala:d-Lac ligase VanA led to the  understanding of the molecular basis for its specificity, but that of d-Ala:d-Ser  ligases had not been determined. We have investigated the enzymatic kinetics of  the d-Ala:d-Ser ligase VanG from Enterococcus faecalis and solved its crystal  structure in complex with ADP. The overall structure of VanG is similar to that  of VanA but has significant differences mainly in the N-terminal and central  domains. Based on reported mutagenesis data and comparison of the VanG and VanA  structures, we show that residues Asp-243, Phe-252, and Arg-324 are molecular  determinants for d-Ser selectivity. These residues are conserved in both enzymes   and explain why VanA also displays d-Ala:d-Ser ligase activity, albeit with low  catalytic efficiency in comparison with VanG. These observations suggest that  d-Ala:d-Lac and d-Ala:d-Ser enzymes have evolved from a common ancestral  d-Ala:d-X ligase. The crystal structure of VanG showed an unusual interaction  between two dimers involving residues of the omega loop that are deeply anchored   in the active site. We constructed an octapeptide mimicking the omega loop and  found that it selectively inhibits VanG and VanA but not Staphylococcus aureus  d-Ala:d-Ala ligase. This study provides additional insight into the molecular  evolution of d-Ala:d-X ligases and could contribute to the development of new  structure-based inhibitors of vancomycin resistance enzymes.
