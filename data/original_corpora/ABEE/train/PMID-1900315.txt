Mechanisms of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and methods for  laboratory detection.

Three distinctly different mechanisms of methicillin resistance have been  described in Staphylococcus aureus. The best-documented and probably most  important mechanism is production of a unique, low affinity penicillin binding  protein, PBP 2a. Strains possessing PBP 2a are resistant to methicillin,  oxacillin, and probably all other currently available beta-lactam antibiotics.  Two additional mechanisms of reduced susceptibility to methicillin have been  described. Borderline resistance (BORSA) to the semi-synthetic penicillins has  been attributed to the hyperproduction of normal staphylococcal beta-lactamase. A  third mechanism has recently been advanced that describes an intermediate level  of resistance to methicillin due to production of modified, normal PBPs with  reduced affinity for beta-lactams (MODSA). Little is known regarding the  prevalence or clinical significance of the BORSA and MODSA strains. The most  reliable in vitro susceptibility test methods for detecting MRSA (strains  possessing PBP 2a) include the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration  (MIC) test (with 2% NaCl supplemented broth), the oxacillin agar screen plate  test (incorporating 6 micrograms/ml oxacillin in 4% NaCl supplemented agar), and   the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) disk diffusion  test with oxacillin. All three methods use direct inoculum preparation and  incubation of tests at 35 degrees C for a full 24 hours.
