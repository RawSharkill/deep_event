Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections following esophageal  surgery in patients with impaired defense mechanisms.

This study was conducted to determine whether or not compromised host defense  mechanisms prior to surgery are related to postoperative infections with  methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Neutrophil cytocidal  activities, serum complement and immunoglobulin levels, the in vivo  antibody-producing capacity against pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS), and  cell-mediated immunity (CMI) were evaluated in 22 patients who underwent  esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 1989 and 1990. Postoperatively, nine   patients developed MRSA infections. Anti-PPS IgG was found to be significantly  lower in patients with MRSA infections than in those without (P < 0.01). All the   patients with MRSA infections showed a titer < 600 EU, while all but one of the  non-infected patients showed a titer > 600 EU. Impairment in other components of   the defense mechanisms, apart from a partial deficiency of CMI, did not differ  between the groups. Thus, a preoperative evaluation of the antibody-producing  capacity may serve to predict the development of MRSA-related infections  following major surgery such as esophagectomy.
