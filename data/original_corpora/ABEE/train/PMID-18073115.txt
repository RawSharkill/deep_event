Crystal structure of AcrB in complex with a single transmembrane subunit reveals   another twist. 

Bacterial drug resistance is a serious concern for human health. Multidrug efflux  pumps export a broad variety of substrates out of the cell and thereby convey  resistance to the host. In Escherichia coli, the AcrB:AcrA:TolC efflux complex  forms a principal transporter for which structures of the individual component  proteins have been determined in isolation. Here, we present the X-ray structure   of AcrB in complex with a single transmembrane protein, assigned by mass  spectrometry as YajC. A specific rotation of the periplasmic porter domain of  AcrB is also revealed, consistent with the hypothesized "twist-to-open" mechanism  for TolC activation. Growth experiments with yajc-deleted E. coli reveal a modest  increase in the organism's susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, but this  effect could not conclusively be attributed to the loss of interactions between  YajC and AcrB.
