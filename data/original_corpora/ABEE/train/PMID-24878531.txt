Bacterial multidrug efflux pumps: mechanisms, physiology and pharmacological  exploitations. 

Multidrug resistance (MDR) refers to the capability of bacterial pathogens to  withstand lethal doses of structurally diverse drugs which are capable of  eradicating non-resistant strains. MDR has been identified as a major threat to  the public health of human being by the World Health Organization (WHO). Among  the four general mechanisms that cause antibiotic resistance including target  alteration, drug inactivation, decreased permeability and increased efflux, drug   extrusion by the multidrug efflux pumps serves as an important mechanism of MDR.   Efflux pumps not only can expel a broad range of antibiotics owing to their  poly-substrate specificity, but also drive the acquisition of additional  resistance mechanisms by lowering intracellular antibiotic concentration and  promoting mutation accumulation. Over-expression of multidrug efflux pumps have  been increasingly found to be associated with clinically relevant drug  resistance. On the other hand, accumulating evidence has suggested that efflux  pumps also have physiological functions in bacteria and their expression is  subject tight regulation in response to various of environmental and  physiological signals. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of drug  extrusion, and regulation and physiological functions of efflux pumps is  essential for the development of anti-resistance interventions. In this review,  we summarize the development of these research areas in the recent decades and  present the pharmacological exploitation of efflux pump inhibitors as a promising  anti-drug resistance intervention.
