[Biological basis of fluoride resistance].

The authors synthetically illustrate some fundamental concepts about the  mechanisms through which the oral flora develops fluoride resistance and the main  consequences of this phenomenon at a biochemical and microbiological level. They   briefly discuss the most recent experimental contributes of the literature in  this field.
