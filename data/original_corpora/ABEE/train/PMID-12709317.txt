IMP-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a Pseudomonas putida  clinical isolate. 

A Pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams,  including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a  patient with a urinary tract infection at the University Hospital of Varese in  northern Italy. The isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity   and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pVA758, carrying a new bla(IMP) determinant,  named bla(IMP-12). Plasmid pVA758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to  either Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by  electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance   or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. The IMP-12 enzyme is quite  divergent from other IMP variants: its closest relatives are IMP-8 and IMP-2 (89   and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and IMP-1 is 85% identical to IMP-12.  The bla(IMP-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose  attC recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing  bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-6), bla(IMP-7), bla(IMP-10), and bla(IMP-11) and unrelated to  that present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-2) and bla(IMP-8). IMP-12 was  overproduced in E. coli by using a T7-based expression system and was purified by  cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. Kinetic analysis  revealed that, like other IMP variants, IMP-12 exhibits an overall preference for  cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze  temocillin and aztreonam. However, IMP-12 also exhibits some notable functional  differences from other IMP variants, including uniformly poor activity toward  penicillins (k(cat)/K(m) values, around 10(4) M(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high  K(m) (around 900 micro M) for imipenem.
