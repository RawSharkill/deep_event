E ffl ux in the Oral Metagenome: The Discovery of a Novel Tetracycline and  Tigecycline ABC Transporter. 

Antibiotic resistance in human bacterial pathogens and commensals is threatening   our ability to treat infections and conduct common medical procedures. As novel  antibiotics are discovered and marketed it is important that we understand how  resistance to them may arise and know what environments may act as reservoirs for  such resistance genes. In this study a tetracycline and tigecycline resistant  clone was identified by screening a human saliva metagenomic library in  Escherichia coli EPI300 on agar containing 5 mug/ml tetracycline. Sequencing of  the DNA insert present within the tetracycline resistant clone revealed it to  contain a 7,765 bp fragment harboring novel ABC half transporter genes,  tetAB(60). Mutagenesis studies performed on these genes confirmed that they were   responsible for the tetracycline and tigecycline resistance phenotypes. Growth  studies performed using E. coli EPI300 clones that harbored either the wild type,  the mutated, or none of these genes indicated that there was a fitness cost  associated with presence of these genes, with the isolate harboring both genes  exhibiting a significantly slower growth than control strains. Given the  emergence of E. coli strains that are sensitive only to tigecycline and  doxycycline it is concerning that such a resistance mechanism has been identified  in the human oral cavity.
