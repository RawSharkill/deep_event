E. coli K-12 and EHEC genes regulated by SdiA. 

BACKGROUND: Escherichia and Salmonella encode SdiA, a transcription factor of the  LuxR family that regulates genes in response to N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs)  produced by other species of bacteria. E. coli genes that change expression in  the presence of plasmid-encoded sdiA have been identified by several labs.  However, many of these genes were identified by overexpressing sdiA on a plasmid   and have not been tested for a response to sdiA produced from its natural  position in the chromosome or for a response to AHL. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL  FINDINGS: We determined that two important loci reported to respond to  plasmid-based sdiA, ftsQAZ and acrAB, do not respond to sdiA expressed from its  natural position in the chromosome or to AHLs. To identify genes that are  regulated by chromosomal sdiA and/or AHLs, we screened 10,000 random  transposon-based luciferase fusions in E. coli K-12 and a further 10,000 in E.  coli O157:H7 for a response to AHL and then tested these genes for  sdiA-dependence. We found that genes encoding the glutamate-dependent acid  resistance system are up-regulated, and fliE is down-regulated, by sdiA. Gene  regulation by sdiA of E. coli is only partially dependent upon AHL.  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genes of E. coli that respond to plasmid-based  expression of sdiA are largely different than those that respond to chromosomal  sdiA and/or AHL. This has significant implications for determining the true  function of AHL detection by E. coli.
