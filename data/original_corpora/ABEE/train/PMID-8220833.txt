[The current concepts of the mechanisms of the therapeutic-prophylactic action of  probiotics from bacteria in the genus Bacillus].

Data from literature as well as the authors' experimental data on the mechanism  of the effect of probiotics from aerobic sporeforming bacteria have been first  generalized. The authors made a conclusion that the effect of biopreparations  from bacilli is the multifactor process, when bacilli get to the gastrointestinal  tract they begin producing biologically active substances which make the  immediate effect on pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms as  well as activate specific and nonspecific systems of the macroorganism  protection. The unknown before phenomenon of bacteria translocation is analyzed  in detail as one of the most important factors of activation of non-specific  resistance of the macroorganisms. Aerobic sporeforming bacteria produce a number   of enzymes, amino acids, antibiotic substances and other biologically active  substrates which add to the complex treatment-prophylactic effect of  biopreparations from these bacteria. Prospects of the use of probiotics based on   aerobic sporeforming bacteria in medicine and veterinary are considered. It is  emphasized, in particular, that the potential multifactor character of the  treatment-prophylactic efficiency of biological preparations from Bacillus is of   positive value, since no negative effects are evoked by the known mechanisms of  specific effect of aerobic sporeforming bacteria. This opens wide potentialities   for improving the schemes and methods of application of probiotics from bacilli,   creation of new forms of drugs on their base as well as to combine them with  other preparations.
