Indole induces the expression of multidrug exporter genes in Escherichia coli. 

Our comprehensive expression cloning studies previously revealed that 20  intrinsic xenobiotic exporter systems are encoded in the Escherichia coli  chromosome, but most of them are not expressed under normal conditions. In this  study, we investigated the compounds that induce the expression of these  xenobiotic exporter genes, and found that indole induces a variety of xenobiotic   exporter genes including acrD, acrE, cusB, emrK, mdtA, mdtE and yceL. Indole  treatment of E. coli cells confers rhodamine 6G and SDS resistance through the  induction of mdtEF and acrD gene expression respectively. The induction of mdtE  by indole is independent of the EvgSA two-component signal transduction system  that regulates the mdtE gene, but mediated by GadX. On the other hand, the  induction of acrD and mdtA was mediated by BaeSR and CpxAR, two-component  systems. Interestingly, CpxAR system-mediated induction required intrinsic baeSR   genes, whereas BaeSR-mediated induction was observed in the cpxAR gene-deletion  mutant. BaeR and CpxR directly bound to different sequences of the acrD and mdtA   promoter regions. These observations indicate that BaeR is a primary regulator,  and CpxR enhances the effect of BaeR.
