Novel integron gene cassette arrays identified in a global collection of  multi-drug resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica. 

Investigation of integron carriage in a global collection of multi-drug resistant  Salmonella enterica identified 3 unique class 1 integron gene cassette arrays not  previously reported in this species. The present study used PCR and DNA sequence   analysis to characterize the structure of these gene cassette arrays. A  approximately 4.0 kb integron containing the gene cassette array arr2/cmlA5/bla  (OXA10) /aadA1 was found in isolates belonging to serovars Isangi and Typhimurium  from South Africa. A approximately 6.0 kb integron containing the gene cassettes   aac(6')IIc/ereA2/IS1247/aac/arr/ereA2 was found in isolates belonging to serovar   Heidelberg from the Philippines. In this gene cassette array, the insertion  sequence, IS1247, and two putative resistance genes, disrupt the erythromycin  resistance gene cassette. Finally, a approximately 6.0 kb integron containing the  gene cassette qacH/dfrA32/ereA1/aadA2/cmlA/aadA1 was found in serovar Stanley  isolates from Taiwan. This integron, which has not been previously reported in  any bacterial species, contains a new dihydrofolate reductase gene cassette  sequence designated dfrA32, with only 90% sequence similarity to previously  reported dfrA cassettes. The S. enterica integrons described in the present study  represent novel collections of resistance genes which confer multi-drug  resistance and have the potential to be widely disseminated among S. enterica as   well as other bacterial species.
