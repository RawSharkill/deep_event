Copper resistance mechanisms in bacteria and fungi.

Copper is both an essential micronutrient and a toxic heavy metal for most living  cells. The presence of high concentrations of cupric ions in the environment  promotes the selection of microorganisms possessing genetic determinants for  copper resistance. Several examples of chromosomal and plasmid copper-resistance   systems in bacteria have been reported, and the mechanisms of resistance have  started to be understood at the molecular level. Bacterial mechanisms of copper  resistance are related to reduced copper transport, enhanced efflux of cupric  ions, or copper complexation by cell components. Copper tolerance in fungi has  also been ascribed to diverse mechanisms involving trapping of the metal by  cell-wall components, altered uptake of copper, extracellular chelation or  precipitation by secreted metabolites, and intracellular complexing by  metallothioneins and phytochelatins; only the metallothionein chelation mechanism  has been approached with molecular detail.
