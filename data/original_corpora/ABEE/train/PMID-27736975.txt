CpxR Activates MexAB-OprM Efflux Pump Expression and Enhances Antibiotic  Resistance in Both Laboratory and Clinical nalB-Type Isolates of Pseudomonas  aeruginosa. 

Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) efflux pumps are responsible for multidrug  resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we demonstrate that CpxR,  previously identified as a regulator of the cell envelope stress response in  Escherichia coli, is directly involved in activation of expression of RND efflux   pump MexAB-OprM in P. aeruginosa. A conserved CpxR binding site was identified  upstream of the mexA promoter in all genome-sequenced P. aeruginosa strains. CpxR  is required to enhance mexAB-oprM expression and drug resistance, in the absence   of repressor MexR, in P. aeruginosa strains PA14. As defective mexR is a genetic   trait associated with the clinical emergence of nalB-type multidrug resistance in  P. aeruginosa during antibiotic treatment, we investigated the involvement of  CpxR in regulating multidrug resistance among resistant isolates generated in the  laboratory via antibiotic treatment and collected in clinical settings. CpxR is  required to activate expression of mexAB-oprM and enhances drug resistance, in  the absence or presence of MexR, in ofloxacin cefsulodin resistant isolates  generated in the laboratory. Furthermore, CpxR was also important in the  mexR-defective clinical isolates. The newly identified regulatory linkage between  CpxR and the MexAB-OprM efflux pump highlights the presence of a complex  regulatory network modulating multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa.
