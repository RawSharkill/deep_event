Keeping New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 at the door. 

New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 is a recently described gene that codes for  carbapenem resistance. Inherently transferable between Gram-negative bacteria on   a plasmid that also confers extended antibiotic resistance, it represents a  potentially serious problem for susceptible patients, such as burn victims, and  is spreading globally at a rapid rate. The authors present a case of a septic  burn patient returning from India, whose microbiological cultures grew bacteria  expressing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. His TBSA was 14%. His length of  stay as an inpatient was 95 days. This is the first case report of this  resistance strain from a U.K. burns unit. Isolation, barrier nursing and the use   of hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination proved effective in limiting  transmission and spread. The authors are of the opinion that their experience has  implications for the management of similar cases in the future.
