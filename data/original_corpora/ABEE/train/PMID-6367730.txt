Bacterial transformations of and resistances to heavy metals.

Bacteria carry out chemical transformations of heavy metals. These  transformations (including oxidation, reduction, methylation, and demethylation)   are sometimes byproducts of normal metabolism and confer no known advantage upon   the organism responsible. Sometimes, however, the transformations constitute a  mechanism of resistance. Many species of bacteria have genes that control  resistances to specific toxic heavy metals. These resistances often are  determined by extrachromosomal DNA molecules (plasmids). The same mechanisms of  resistance occur in bacteria from soil, water, industrial waste, and clinical  sources. The mechanism of mercury and organomercurial resistance is the enzymatic  detoxification of the mercurials into volatile species (methane, ethane, metallic  HgO) which are rapidly lost from the environment. Cadmium and arsenate  resistances are due to reduced net accumulation of these toxic materials.  Efficient efflux pumps cause the rapid excretion of Cd2+ and AsO4(3-). The  mechanisms of arsenite and of antimony resistance, usually found associated with   arsenate resistance, are not known. Silver resistance is due to lowered affinity   of the cells for Ag+, which can be complexed with extracellular halides, thiols,   or organic compounds. Sensitivity is due to binding of Ag+ more effectively to  cells than to Cl-.
