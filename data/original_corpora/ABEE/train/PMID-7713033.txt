Pollutant effects on the microbial ecosystem.

Genetic diversity of a microbial community will inevitably be affected by  environmental stress. However, our understanding of the implications of these  effects is limited. Genetic exchange between natural microbial communities  appears to be a common phenomenon, mediated by a number of microbial processes  (conjugation, transformation, and transduction). These mechanisms of change are  presumably adaptations to natural environmental perturbation, e.g., the low  levels of antibiotics produced by other organisms. However, anthropogenic  influences on the environment may be accelerating genetic change within  microbiologic ecosystems, beyond these natural adaptation rates. This article  highlights some of the perceived risks to ecosystem health and research questions  that need to be addressed.
