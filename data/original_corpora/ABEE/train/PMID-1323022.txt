gyrB mutations which confer coumarin resistance also affect DNA supercoiling and   ATP hydrolysis by Escherichia coli DNA gyrase. 

Coumarins are inhibitors of the ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling reactions  catalysed by DNA gyrase. Their target is the B subunit of gyrase (GyrB), encoded   by the gyrB gene. The exact mode and site of action of the drugs is unknown. We  have identified four mutations conferring coumarin resistance to Escherichia  coli: Arg-136 to Cys, His or Ser and Gly-164 to Val. In vitro, the ATPase and  supercoiling activities of the mutant GyrB proteins are reduced relative to the  wild-type enzyme and show resistance to the coumarin antibiotics. Significant  differences in the susceptibility of mutant GyrB proteins to inhibition by either  chlorobiocin and novobiocin or coumermycin have been found, suggesting wider  contacts between coumermycin and GyrB. We discuss the significance of Arg-136 and  Gly-164 in relation to the notion that coumarin drugs act as competitive  inhibitors of the ATPase reaction.
