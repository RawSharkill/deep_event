Target transcription binding sites differentiate two groups of MerR-monovalent  metal ion sensors. 

The evolution of bacterial regulatory circuits often involves duplication of  genes encoding transcription factors that may suffer both modifications in their   detected signals, as well as, rewiring of their target operators. This, and  subsequent horizontal gene transfer events contribute to generate a diverse array  of regulatory pathways. In Salmonella, two homologous transcription factors CueR   and GolS are responsible for Cu and Au sensing and resistance respectively. They   share similarities not only in their sequence but also in their target binding  sites, although they cluster separately among MerR-monovalent metal sensors.  Here, we demonstrate that CueR and GolS can selectively distinguish their target   binding sites by recognizing bases at positions 3' and 3 of their cognate  operators. Swap of these bases results in switching regulator dependency. The  differences in promoter architecture plus the environmentally controlled  regulator's cytoplasmic availability warrant intra-regulon regulator-operator  selectivity, and the proper response to metal injury. Furthermore, the presence  of the distinctive operators' bases is widely extended among the two groups of  MerR-monovalent metal sensors, providing evidence of the co-evolution of these  factors and their target operators. This approach allows the prediction of  regulator's dependency and the identification of transcription modules among  groups of homologous transcription factors.
