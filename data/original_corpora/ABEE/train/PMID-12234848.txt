EBR-1, a novel Ambler subclass B1 beta-lactamase from Empedobacter brevis. 

Empedobacter brevis (formerly designated Flavobacterium breve) is a gram-negative  aerobe involved in nosocomial infections. The Ambler class B beta-lactamase gene   bla(EBR-1) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli from E. brevis clinical  strain ASS-1, which had reduced susceptibility to expanded-spectrum  cephalosporins and carbapenems. Purified beta-lactamase EBR-1 hydrolyzed  penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems efficiently but not aztreonam.  Kinetic parameters of EBR-1 were similar to those of class B enzymes such as  BlaB, IND-2, and GOB-1 identified from other Flavobacteriaceae species, except  for meropenem, which was more hydrolyzed by beta-lactamase GOB-1. EBR-1, with a  pI of 8.0 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 25 kDa, was classified in  functional subgroup 3a, which includes most of the class B beta-lactamases.  EBR-1, which belongs to molecular subclass B1 of metalloenzymes, shares 58, 57,  and 42% amino acid identity with the most closely related beta-lactamases,  IND-1/IND-2 from Chryseobacterium indologenes, CGB-1 from Chryseobacterium gleum,  and BlaB from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, respectively.
