[Genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in bacteria of the genus  Salmonella].

Distribution of genetic determinants of resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin,  chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfanilamides and trimethoprim in strains of  Salmonella isolated from studied. The majority of the resistant strains carried  the genes of aminoglycoside-3"-phosphotransferase, type I  aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase, type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  and type II dihydropteroate synthetase. Tetracycline resistance in the strains  was often due to the class B tetracycline resistance genetic determinants. It was  suggested that the resistance mechanisms controlled by these genes provided  higher levels of resistance to the above drugs in Salmonella as compared to the  other mechanisms. Plasmid resistance genes were detected in more than 90 per cent  of the clinical strains and in 35 per cent of the sporadic strains of S.  typhimurium. The antibiotic resistance of the Salmonella strains of other  serovars was not as a rule controlled by the plasmid genes.
