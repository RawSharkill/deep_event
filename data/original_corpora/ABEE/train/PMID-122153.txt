[The importance of chemoantibiotic resistance in controlling infections disease  (author's transl)].

The AA. examine those mechanisms which might determine the phenomenon of drug  resistance in microorganism. They then review those infections of interest to  public health. Diseases such as meningococcus, enterobacterial and vibro  infections frequently show chemoantibiotic resistance. The AA. procede to point  out the problems which may arise during therapy or prophylaxis. Some measures are  then reported as necessary in order to prevent or retard the development of drug   resistance in microorganism.
