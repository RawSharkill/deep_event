Interaction between radiation and drug damage in mammalian cells. V. DNA damage  and repair induced in LZ cells by adriamycin and/or radiation.

A multi-drug-resistant cell line selected in increasing concentrations of  Adriamycin and designated LZ (J. A. Belli, Radiat. Res. 119, 88-100, 1989) is  shown to exhibit a survival response characterized by radiation sensitivity and  Adriamycin resistance. To determine if this response is due to alterations in  either the initial levels of damage induced or the repair of DNA damage, LZ cells  and the parental V79 cells were exposed to either radiation or Adriamycin and the  damage and repair were measured with alkaline or nondenaturing filter elution.  After exposure to radiation, induction and repair of both single-strand and  double-strand breaks were equivalent. LZ cells exposed to 100 micrograms/ml  Adriamycin for 1 h contained no measurable damage while the same treatment  induced breaks and crosslinks in V79 cells. Pretreatment of LZ cells for 1 h with  Adriamycin before irradiation did not alter either the initial levels of induced   damage or the repair of strand breakage. These results suggest that (1)  mechanisms other than differential induction and repair of strand breaks are  responsible for the increased radiation sensitivity in LZ, and (2) the lack of  Adriamycin induced DNA damage in LZ is at least partially responsible for the  increased cell survival after treatment.
