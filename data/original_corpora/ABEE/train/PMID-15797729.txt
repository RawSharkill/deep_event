Trimeric structure of OprN and OprM efflux proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa,   by 2D electron crystallography. 

OprM and OprN belong to the outer membrane factor family of multidrug efflux  proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium responsible of nosocomial  infections. We report here the two-dimensional (2D) crystallization of OprN and  OprM into lipid bilayers and the determination of their 2D projected structure by  cryo-electron crystallography, at 1 and 1.4 nm, respectively. Both proteins  present a dense ring of protein density, of approximately 7 nm diameter. An  additional thin peripheral ring is resolved in OprN structure. Both proteins are   assembled as trimers. The results presented here indicate a high structural  homology between OprN (and OprM) and TolC, a multidrug efflux protein from  Escherichia coli.
