Multidrug resistance in lactic acid bacteria: molecular mechanisms and clinical  relevance. 

The active extrusion of cytotoxic compounds from the cell by multidrug  transporters is one of the major causes of failure of chemotherapeutic treatment   of tumor cells and of infections by pathogenic microorganisms. The secondary  multidrug transporter LmrP and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type multidrug  transporter LmrA in Lactococcus lactis are representatives of the two major  classes of multidrug transporters found in pro- and eukaryotic organisms.  Therefore, knowledge of the molecular properties of LmrP and LmrA will have a  wide significance for multidrug transporters in all living cells, and may enable   the development of specific inhibitors and of new drugs which circumvent the  action of multidrug transporters. Interestingly, LmrP and LmrA are transport  proteins with very different protein structures, which use different mechanisms  of energy coupling to transport drugs out of the cell. Surprisingly, both  proteins have overlapping specificities for drugs, are inhibited by the same set   of modulators, and transport drugs via a similar transport mechanism. The  structure-function relationships that dictate drug recognition and transport by  LmrP and LmrA will represent an intriguing new area of research.
