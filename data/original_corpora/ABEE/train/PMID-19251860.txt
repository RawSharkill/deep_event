The LiaFSR system regulates the cell envelope stress response in Streptococcus  mutans. 

Maintaining cell envelope integrity is critical for bacterial survival, including  bacteria living in a complex and dynamic environment such as the human oral  cavity. Streptococcus mutans, a major etiological agent of dental caries, uses  two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTSs) to monitor and respond to  various environmental stimuli. Previous studies have shown that the LiaSR TCSTS  in S. mutans regulates virulence traits such as acid tolerance and biofilm  formation. Although not examined in streptococci, homologs of LiaSR are widely  disseminated in Firmicutes and function as part of the cell envelope stress  response network. We describe here liaSR and its upstream liaF gene in the cell  envelope stress tolerance of S. mutans strain UA159. Transcriptional analysis  established liaSR as part of the pentacistronic liaFSR-ppiB-pnpB operon. A survey  of cell envelope antimicrobials revealed that mutants deficient in one or all of   the liaFSR genes were susceptible to Lipid II cycle interfering antibiotics and  to chemicals that perturbed the cell membrane integrity. These compounds induced   liaR transcription in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, under bacitracin  stress conditions, the LiaFSR signaling system was shown to induce transcription   of several genes involved in membrane protein synthesis, peptidoglycan  biosynthesis, envelope chaperone/proteases, and transcriptional regulators. In  the absence of an inducer such as bacitracin, LiaF repressed LiaR-regulated  expression, whereas supplementing cultures with bacitracin resulted in  derepression of liaSR. While LiaF appears to be an integral component of the  LiaSR signaling cascade, taken collectively, we report a novel role for LiaFSR in  sensing cell envelope stress and preserving envelope integrity in S. mutans.
