Contribution of mutation at amino acid 45 of AcrR to acrB expression and  ciprofloxacin resistance in clinical and veterinary Escherichia coli isolates.

Fluoroquinolone resistant Escherichia coli isolates which overexpressed acrB and   had a substitution at amino acid 45 of AcrR were complemented with wild-type  acrR. Complementation led to increased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and to  ethidium bromide, suggesting that mutation at amino acid 45 of AcrR contributes  to ciprofloxacin resistance.
