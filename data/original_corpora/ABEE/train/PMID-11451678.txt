Metallo-beta-lactamases in clinical Pseudomonas isolates in Taiwan and  identification of VIM-3, a novel variant of the VIM-2 enzyme. 

A total of 209 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas (193 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10  P. putida, 4 P. stutzeri, and 2 P. fluorescens isolates) with reduced  susceptibilities to imipenem and/or ceftazidime were subjected to PCR assays with  primers specific for bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-2), bla(VIM-1), and bla(VIM-2) and  sequence analysis to identify the metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) prevalent among   these organisms in Taiwan; and 21 isolates gave positive results. Five isolates  including two P. putida and three P. stutzeri isolates were found to carry  bla(IMP-1), and six isolates including five P. putida and one P. stutzeri  isolates harbored bla(VIM-2). The remaining 10 isolates were P. aeruginosa, and  all were found to carry a novel variant of bla(VIM-2), designated bla(VIM-3).  There are only two nucleotide differences between bla(VIM-2) and bla(VIM-3),  leading to two amino acid alterations. Our findings indicate that VIM-2 and its  variant have become the most prevalent metalloenzymes in Pseudomonas in Taiwan.  Southern hybridization with the bla(VIM-2)-, bla(VIM-3)-, and bla(IMP-1  )-specific probes revealed that only two VIM-2-producing P. putida isolates  appeared to carry the MBL gene on plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  showed that six VIM-3-producing P. aeruginosa isolates and two IMP-1-producing P.  stutzeri isolates were genetically related, suggesting that the spread of these  MBL genes in Taiwan could be due to clonal dissemination as well as genetic  exchange between different clones.
