Characterization of a novel IMP-28 metallo-beta-lactamase from a Spanish  Klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate. 

An isolate of Klebsiella oxytoca carrying a novel IMP metallo-beta-lactamase was   discovered in Madrid, Spain. The bla(IMP-28) gene is part of a chromosomally  located class I integron. The IMP-28 k(cat)/K(m) values for ampicillin,  ceftazidime, and cefepime and, to a lesser extent, imipenem and meropenem, are  clearly lower than those of IMP-1. The His306Gln mutation may induce important  modifications of the L3 loop and thus of substrate accessibility and hydrolysis  and be the main reason for this behavior.
