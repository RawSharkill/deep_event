Anomalous high native resistance to athymic mice to bacterial pathogens.

Congenitally athymic (nude) mice exhibited an anomalous high resistance against  infections with the facultative intracellular parasite Listeria monocytogenes and  other bacterial pathogens. Protection against lethal infection was demonstrated  to result from the presence of naturally occurring activated macrophages in the  reticuloendothelial organs of the nude mice. This was exemplified after  intravenous challenge by enhanced bacterial clearance from the blood and  augmented bacterial killing in the spleens and livers of nude mice as compared  with immunologically competent control mice. Resident peritoneal macrophages of  nude mice were not activated in terms of phagocytic, bactericidal, or tumoricidal  potential. The development of activated fixed tissue macrophages appears to arise  as a result of the T-lymphocyte deficiency since thymus implantation abrogated  the enhanced resistance of nude mice. Antibiotic elimination of intestinal  bacteria also modified resistance to bacterial infection, indicating a role of  environmental factors on macrophage activation. Several possible mechanisms  leading to macrophage activation and heightened resistance to infection in nude  mice are offered.
