The Pseudomonas aeruginosa efflux pump MexGHI-OpmD transports a natural phenazine  that controls gene expression and biofilm development.

Redox-cycling compounds, including endogenously produced phenazine antibiotics,  induce expression of the efflux pump MexGHI-OpmD in the opportunistic pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa Previous studies of P. aeruginosa virulence, physiology,  and biofilm development have focused on the blue phenazine pyocyanin and the  yellow phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). In P. aeruginosa phenazine  biosynthesis, conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is presumed to proceed through the  intermediate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate (5-Me-PCA), a reactive compound that  has eluded detection in most laboratory samples. Here, we apply electrochemical  methods to directly detect 5-Me-PCA and find that it is transported by  MexGHI-OpmD in P. aeruginosa strain PA14 planktonic and biofilm cells. We also  show that 5-Me-PCA is sufficient to fully induce MexGHI-OpmD expression and that   it is required for wild-type colony biofilm morphogenesis. These physiological  effects are consistent with the high redox potential of 5-Me-PCA, which  distinguishes it from other well-studied P. aeruginosa phenazines. Our  observations highlight the importance of this compound, which was previously  overlooked due to the challenges associated with its detection, in the context of  P. aeruginosa gene expression and multicellular behavior. This study constitutes   a unique demonstration of efflux-based self-resistance, controlled by a simple  circuit, in a Gram-negative pathogen.
