Structure of metallo-beta-lactamase IND-7 from a Chryseobacterium indologenes  clinical isolate at 1.65-A resolution. 

The X-ray crystal structure of metallo-beta-lactamase from Chryseobacterium  indologenes IND-7 was determined at a resolution of 1.65 A. The overall structure  adopted a four-layered alphabeta/betaalpha sandwich structure with a dinuclear  zinc(II) active site, in which the zinc(II) ions were denoted as Zn1 and Zn2. The  overall structure of IND-7 is analogous to those of subclass B1  metallo-beta-lactamases, as determined by X-ray crystallography. A significant  structural difference, however, was observed in the dinuclear zinc(II) active  site: the coordination geometry around Zn1 changed from tetrahedral, found in  other subclass B1 metallo-beta-lactamases, to distorted trigonal bipyramidal,  whereas that of Zn2 changed from trigonal bipyramidal to tetrahedral.  Arg121(101), which is located in the vicinity of the dinuclear zinc(II) active  site, may affect the binding affinity of Zn2 due to an electronic repulsion  between the zinc(II) ion(s) and a positively charged guanidyl group of  Arg121(101). Moreover, the hydrogen-bonding interaction of Arg121 with Ser71(53),  which is conserved in IND-1, IND-3 and IND-5-IND-7, appeared to have important  consequences for the binding affinity of Zn2 in conjunction with the above  electrostatic effect.
