Genetic markers of widespread extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa  high-risk clones. 

Recent reports have revealed the existence of widespread extensively  drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa high-risk clones in health care settings, but   there is still scarce information on their specific chromosomal (mutational) and   acquired resistance mechanisms. Up to 20 (10.5%) of 190 bloodstream isolates  collected from 10 Spanish hospitals met the XDR criteria. A representative number  (15 per group) of isolates classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR) (22.6%),  resistant to 1 to 2 classes (moderately resistant [modR]) (23.7%), or susceptible  to all antibiotics (multiS) (43.2%) were investigated in parallel. Multilocus  sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that all XDR isolates belonged to  sequence type 175 (ST175) (n = 19) or ST111 (n = 1), both recognized as  international high-risk clones. Clonal diversity was higher among the 15 MDR  isolates (4 ST175, 2 ST111, and 8 additional STs) and especially high among the  15 modR (13 different STs) and multiS (14 STs) isolates. The XDR/MDR pattern in  ST111 isolates correlated with the production of VIM-2, but none of the ST175  isolates produced acquired beta-lactamases. In contrast, the analysis of  resistance markers in 12 representative isolates (from 7 hospitals) of ST175  revealed that the XDR pattern was driven by the combination of AmpC  hyperproduction, OprD inactivation (Q142X), 3 mutations conferring high-level  fluoroquinolone resistance (GyrA T83I and D87N and ParC S87W), a G195E mutation  in MexZ (involved in MexXY-OprM overexpression), and the production of a class 1   integron harboring the aadB gene (gentamicin and tobramycin resistance). Of  particular interest, in nearly all the ST175 isolates, AmpC hyperproduction was  driven by a novel AmpR-activating mutation (G154R), as demonstrated by  complementation studies using an ampR mutant of PAO1. This work is the first to  describe the specific resistance markers of widespread P. aeruginosa XDR  high-risk clones producing invasive infections.
