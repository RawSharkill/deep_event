Genome-wide analyses of Escherichia coli gene expression responsive to the BaeSR   two-component regulatory system. 

The BaeSR two-component regulatory system controls expression of exporter genes  conferring drug resistance in Escherichia coli (S. Nagakubo, K. Nishino, T.  Hirata, and A. Yamaguchi, J. Bacteriol. 184:4161-4167, 2002; N. Baranova and H.  Nikaido, J. Bacteriol. 184:4168-4176, 2002). To understand the whole picture of  BaeSR regulation, a DNA microarray analysis of the effect of BaeR overproduction   was performed. BaeR overproduction activated 59 genes related to two-component  signal transduction, chemotactic responses, flagellar biosynthesis, maltose  transport, and multidrug transport, and BaeR overproduction also repressed the  expression of the ibpA and ibpB genes. All of the changes in the expression  levels were also observed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR  analysis. The expression levels of 15 of the 59 BaeR-activated genes were  decreased by deletion of baeSR. Of 11 genes induced by indole (a putative inducer  of the BaeSR system), 10 required the BaeSR system for induction. Combination of   the expression data sets revealed a BaeR-binding site sequence motif,  5'-TTTTTCTCCATDATTGGC-3' (where D is G, A, or T). Several genes up-regulated by  BaeR overproduction, including genes for maltose transport, chemotactic  responses, and flagellar biosynthesis, required an intact PhoBR or CreBC  two-component regulatory system for up-regulation. These data indicate that there  is cross-regulation among the BaeSR, PhoBR, and CreBC two-component regulatory  systems. Such a global analysis should reveal the regulatory network of the BaeSR  system.
