GyrA ser83 and ParC trp106 Mutations in Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi  Isolated from Typhoid Fever Patients in Tertiary Care Hospital. 

INTRODUCTION: Typhoid fever is endemic in India and other developing countries,  causing major public health problems with high morbidity and mortality. The  resistance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) towards commonly  prescribed antimicrobials is increasing in developing countries. However, there  have been several reports of the therapeutic failure of fluoroquinolones in  patients with Salmonella infection. Resistance to quinolones/ fluoroquinolones  commonly arises due to target site mutation. AIM: The present study was planned  to analyze mutation in Quinolone Resistance Determining Region (QRDR) of  quinolone resistant Salmonella isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 133 S.  Typhi isolates (blood (n = 131), stool (n=1) and bone marrow aspirate (n=1)) from  tertiary care hospitals in Chennai and Puducherry, were included in this study.  Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) were carried out according to the  Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)guidelines 2014. Mutations in gyrA  and parC genes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length  Polymorphism) method followed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 133 S. Typhi,  99.2% were resistant to nalidixic acid and 21% were resistant to ciprofloxacin by  MIC method. 94% of isolates showed Ser 83 mutation in gyrA and 21.8% of isolates   showed Trp106-Gly mutation in parC. CONCLUSION: Mutations in gyrA and parC genes   are highly prevalent among Salmonella species. Irrational use of fluoroquinolones  may increase the accumulation of mutations in the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase  encoding genes, which lead to the emergence of high level  fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella strains in future.
