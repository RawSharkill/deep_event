Detection and characterization of VIM-31, a new variant of VIM-2 with Tyr224His  and His252Arg mutations, in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae. 

We report the first description of the metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-31, a new  variant of VIM-2 with Tyr224His and His252Arg mutations, in Enterobacter cloacae   11236, which was isolated from blood specimens of a patient with colonic  adenocarcinoma in Belgium. bla(VIM-31) was found on a class 1 integron located on  a self-transferable but not typeable 42-kb plasmid. Compared to values published   elsewhere for VIM-2, the purified VIM-31 enzyme showed weaker catalytic  efficiency against all the tested beta-lactam agents (except for ertapenem),  resulting from lower k(cat) (except for ertapenem) and higher K(m) values for  VIM-31.
