Small multidrug resistance proteins: a multidrug transporter family that  continues to grow. 

The small multidrug resistance (SMR) protein family is a bacterial multidrug  transporter family. As suggested by their title, SMR proteins are composed of  four transmembrane alpha-helices of approximately 100-140 amino acids in length.   Since their designation as a family, many homologues have been identified and  characterized both structurally and functionally. In this review the topology,  structure, drug resistance, drug binding, and transport mechanisms of the entire   SMR protein family are examined. Additionally, updated bioinformatic analysis of   predicted and characterized SMR protein family members was also conducted. Based   on SMR sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis of current members, we  propose that this small multidrug resistance transporter family should be  expanded into three subclasses: (i) the small multidrug pumps (SMP), (ii)  suppressor of groEL mutation proteins (SUG), and a third group (iii) paired small  multidrug resistance proteins (PSMR). The roles of these three SMR subclasses are  examined, and the well-characterized members, such as Escherichia coli EmrE and  SugE, are described in terms of their function and structural organization.
