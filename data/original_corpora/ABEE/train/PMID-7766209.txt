Nickel resistance mechanisms in yeasts and other fungi.

This review describes nickel toxicity and nickel resistance mechanisms in fungi.   Nickel toxicity in fungi is influenced by environmental factors such as pH,  temperature and the existence of organic matter and other ions. We describe  resistance mechanisms in nickel resistant mutants of yeasts and filamentous fungi  which were obtained by exposure to a mutagen or by successive culture in media  containing increasing concentrations of nickel ion. Nickel resistance may  involve: (1) inactivation of nickel toxicity by the production of extracellular  nickel chelating substances such as glutathione; (2) reduced nickel accumulation,  probably by modification of a magnesium transport system; (3) sequestration of  nickel into a vacuole associated with free histidine and involving  Ni-insensitivity of vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase.
