Genetic characterization of vanG, a novel vancomycin resistance locus of  Enterococcus faecalis. 

Enterococcus faecalis strain WCH9 displays a moderate level of resistance to  vancomycin (MIC = 16 microgram/ml) and full susceptibility to teicoplanin but is   negative by PCR analysis using primers specific for all known enterococcal  vancomycin resistance genotypes (vanA, vanB, vanC, vanD, and vanE). We have  isolated and sequenced a novel putative vancomycin resistance locus (designated  vanG), which contains seven open reading frames, from this strain. These are  organized differently from those of all the other enterococcal van loci, and,  furthermore, the individual vanG gene products exhibit less than 50% amino acid  sequence identity to other van gene products.
