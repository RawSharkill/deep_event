Mutations in PA3574 (nalD) lead to increased MexAB-OprM expression and multidrug   resistance in laboratory and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

Mutations in genes mexR and nalC have previously been shown to drive  overexpression of the MexAB-OprM multidrug efflux system in Pseudomonas  aeruginosa. A transposon insertion multidrug-resistant mutant of P. aeruginosa  overproducing MexAB-OprM was disrupted in yet a third gene, PA3574, encoding a  probable repressor of the TetR/AcrR family that we have dubbed NalD. Clinical  strains overexpressing MexAB-OprM but lacking mutations in mexR or nalC were also  shown to carry mutations in nalD. Moreover, the cloned nalD gene reduced the  multidrug resistance and MexAB-OprM expression of the transposon mutant and  clinical isolates, highlighting the significance of the nalD mutations vis-a-vis   MexAB-OprM overexpression in these isolates.
