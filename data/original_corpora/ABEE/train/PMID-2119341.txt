Characterization of the cytochalasin D resistant (pinocytic) mechanisms of  endocytosis utilized by chlamydiae.

The cytochalasin D resistant (pinocytic) portion of the entry of two chlamydia  strains (Chlamydia trachomatis L2/434/Bu and Chlamydia psittaci GPIC [guinea pig   inclusion conjunctivitis]) was examined. By ultrastructural criteria, few  organisms of either strain were observed in association with coated host-cell  plasma membrane during entry into McCoy cells; this argues against a coated-pit  mechanism of entry. When association with a coated membrane was seen, coat  material appeared to pinch off ahead of internalizing chlamydiae. However, entry   of both strains was substantially reduced by cytosol acidification, a procedure  shown to prevent coated-pit vesiculation (K. Sandvig, S. Olsnes, O. W. Petersen,   and B. van Deurs, J. Cell Biol. 105:679-689, 1987). No conclusive evidence of  displacement of the fluid-phase marker [3H]sucrose from constitutively forming  endocytic vesicles was found. Indeed the entry of strain 434 (but not strain  GPIC) was accompanied by the influx of a large volume of fluid, suggesting an  inducible mechanism. Additionally, entry of strain 434 (but not strain GPIC) was   partially inhibitable by amiloride, yet the drug had no effect on the entry of  transferrin, a ligand known to enter solely via coated pits. Our findings endorse  the view that chlamydial entry can occur via a pathway involving coated pits.  However, the unusual morphology of entry and lack of fluid exclusion are  consistent with a process whereby although chlamydiae are not fully enclosed by  coat material, their entry is dependent on the vesiculation of coated pits.  Furthermore, the data support the proposition that a significant proportion of  the entry of strain 434 occurs via an inducible pathway independent of coated-pit  uptake.
