Mutagenicity profiles of newer amsacrine analogues with activity against solid  tumours: comparison of microbial and mammalian systems.

Amsacrine, an acridine derivative used clinically in the treatment of acute  leukaemia, has formed the basis for the development of further compounds with  high activity against experimental solid tumours, one of which is currently in  clinical trial. We have compared the ability of these drugs to cause point  mutations in bacteria, 'petite' mutations in yeast and mutations in mammalian  cells. Several of the compounds are frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium  TA1537 while some cause 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All are  highly clastogenic and have significant mutagenic activity at the 6-thioguanine  locus in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts following 1 h drug exposures.  None are mutagenic at the ouabain locus of these cells. The relationship between   different indicators of mutagenicity has been studied using an additional set of   amsacrine analogues, some of which are mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA98. There is  a highly significant relationship between mutation frequency (measured as  resistance to 6-thioguanine) and either cytotoxicity (D37 values in a clonogenic   assay) or clastogenicity (ability to induce micronuclei). However, there is no  correlation with mutagenicity in microbial systems. The results suggest that the   cytotoxicity, clastogenicity and mutagenic activity of the amsacrine analogues is  mediated by similar mechanisms, probably involving the enzyme DNA topoisomerase  II.
