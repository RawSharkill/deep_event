A diverse intrinsic antibiotic resistome from a cave bacterium.

Antibiotic resistance is ancient and widespread in environmental bacteria. These   are therefore reservoirs of resistance elements and reflective of the natural  history of antibiotics and resistance. In a previous study, we discovered that  multi-drug resistance is common in bacteria isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, an  underground ecosystem that has been isolated from the surface for over 4 Myr.  Here we use whole-genome sequencing, functional genomics and biochemical assays  to reveal the intrinsic resistome of Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a cave bacterial  isolate that is resistant to most clinically used antibiotics. We systematically   link resistance phenotype to genotype and in doing so, identify 18 chromosomal  resistance elements, including five determinants without characterized homologues  and three mechanisms not previously shown to be involved in antibiotic  resistance. A resistome comparison across related surface Paenibacillus affirms  the conservation of resistance over millions of years and establishes the  longevity of these genes in this genus.
