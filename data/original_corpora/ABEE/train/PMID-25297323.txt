A novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain with an oprD mutation in relation to a  nosocomial respiratory infection outbreak in an intensive care unit. 

Seven imipenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were recovered from the   sputum samples of pneumonia patients in southwestern China. They had identical  antibiotic resistance patterns and indistinguishable pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis profiles. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 4-bp (AGTC)  insertion in the oprD gene, resulting in a frameshift in the cognate open reading  frame. These isolates became imipenem susceptible when the chromosomal oprD  lesion was complemented, indicating that the 4-bp insertion in the oprD gene  resulted in imipenem resistance.
