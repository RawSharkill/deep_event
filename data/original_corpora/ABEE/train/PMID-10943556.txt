The major facilitator superfamily. 

In 1998 we updated earlier descriptions of the largest family of secondary  transport carriers found in living organisms, the major facilitator superfamily  (MFS). Seventeen families of transport proteins were shown to comprise this  superfamily. We here report expansion of the MFS to include 29 established  families as well as five probable families. Structural, functional, and  mechanistic features of the constituent permeases are described, and each newly  identified family is shown to exhibit specificity for a single class of  substrates. Phylogenetic analyses define the evolutionary relationships of the  members of each family to each other, and multiple alignments allow definition of  family-specific signature sequences as well as all well-conserved sequence  motifs. The work described serves to update previous publications and allows  extrapolation of structural, functional and mechanistic information obtained with  any one member of the superfamily to other members with limitations determined by  the degrees of sequence divergence.
