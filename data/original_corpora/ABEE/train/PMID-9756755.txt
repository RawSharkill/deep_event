Characterization of In40 of Enterobacter aerogenes BM2688, a class 1 integron  with two new gene cassettes, cmlA2 and qacF. 

Enterobacter aerogenes BM2688, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics, and  its aminoglycoside susceptible derivative BM2688-1 were isolated from the same  clinical sample. Strain BM2688 harbored plasmid pIP833, which carries a class 1  integron, In40, containing (in addition to qacEDelta1 and sul1, which are  characteristic of class 1 integrons) four gene cassettes: aac(6')-Ib, qacF,  cmlA2, and oxa-9. The cmlA2 gene had 83.7% identity with the previously described  nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance cmlA1 gene. The qacF gene conferred  resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds and displayed a high degree of  similarity with qacE (67.8% identity) which, however, has been found as part of a  cassette with a very different 59-base element. The oxa-9 gene was not expressed   due to a lack of promoter sequences. Study of the antibiotic-susceptible  derivative BM2688-1 indicated that a 3,148-bp deletion between the 3' end of the   aac(6')-Ib gene and the 3' conserved segment of In40 was responsible for the loss  of resistance. The occurrence of this DNA rearrangement, which did not involve  homologous sequences, suggests that the In40 integrase could promote  recombination at secondary sites.
