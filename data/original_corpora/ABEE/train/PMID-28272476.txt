Novel methicillin resistance gene mecD in clinical Macrococcus caseolyticus  strains from bovine and canine sources. 

Methicillin resistant Macrococcus caseolyticus strains from bovine and canine  origins were found to carry a novel mecD gene conferring resistance to all  classes of beta-lactams including anti-MRSA cephalosporins. Association of  beta-lactam resistance with mecD was demonstrated by gene expression in S. aureus  and deletion of the mecD-containing island in M. caseolyticus. The mecD gene was   located either on an 18,134-bp M. caseolyticus resistance island (McRImecD-1) or   a 16,188-bp McRImecD-2. Both islands were integrated at the 3' end of the rpsI  gene, carried the mecD operon (mecD-mecR1m-mecIm), and genes for an integrase of   the tyrosine recombinase family and a putative virulence-associated protein  (virE). Apart from the mecD operon, that shared 66% overall nucleotide identity  with the mecB operon, McRImecD islands were unrelated to any mecB-carrying  elements or staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec. Only McRImecD-1 that is  delimitated at both ends by direct repeats was capable of circular excision. The   recombined excision pattern suggests site-specific activity of the integrase and   allowed identification of a putative core attachment site. Detection of  rpsI-associated integrases in Bacillus and S. aureus reveals a potential for  broad-host range dissemination of the novel methicillin resistance gene mecD.
