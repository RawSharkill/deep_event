Novel acquired metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla(SIM-1), in a class 1 integron  from Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from Korea. 

Carbapenem resistance mediated by acquired carbapenemase genes has been  increasingly reported, particularly for clinical isolates of Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Of 1,234 non-duplicate isolates of  carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. isolated at a  tertiary-care hospital in Seoul, Korea, 211 (17%) were positive for  metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Of these, 204 (96%) had either the bla(IMP-1) or  bla(VIM-2) allele. In addition, seven Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were found  to have a novel MBL gene, which was designated bla(SIM-1). The SIM-1 protein has   a pI of 7.2, is a new member of subclass B1, and exhibits 64 to 69% identity with  the IMP-type MBLs, which are its closest relatives. All SIM-1-producing isolates   exhibited relatively low imipenem and meropenem MICs (8 to 16 microg/ml) and had   a multidrug resistance phenotype. Expression of the cloned bla(SIM-1) gene in  Escherichia coli revealed that the encoded enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a  broad array of beta-lactams, including penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum   cephalosporins, and carbapenems. The bla(SIM-1) gene was carried on a gene  cassette inserted into a class 1 integron, which included three additional  cassettes (arr-3, catB3, and aadA1). The strains were isolated from sputum and  urine specimens from patients with pneumonia and urinary tract infections,  respectively. All patients had various underlying diseases. Pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNAs showed that the strains belonged to  two different clonal lineages, indicating that horizontal transfer of this gene  had occurred and suggesting the possibility of further spread of resistance in  the future.
