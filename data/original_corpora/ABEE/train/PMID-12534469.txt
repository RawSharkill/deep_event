Analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa oprD gene from clinical and environmental   isolates. 

Genomes are constantly evolving. Our report highlights the wide mutational  diversity of clinical as well as environmental isolates, compared with the  laboratory strain(s), through the systematic genetic analysis of a chromosomal  porin gene (oprD) in relation to a specific antibiotic resistance. Mutational  inactivation of the oprD gene is associated with carbapenem resistance in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sequence of the oprD gene of 55 Pseudomonas  aeruginosa natural isolates obtained from across the world--from sources as  diverse as patients and rhizospheres--was analysed. A microscale mosaic structure  for this gene--resulting from multiple intra- and possibly interspecies  recombinational events--is reported. An array of independent and seemingly  fast-occurring defective oprD mutations were found, none of which had been  described before. A burn wound isolate demonstrated unusually high overall  sequence variability typical of mutator strains. We also present evidence for the  existence of OprD homologues in other fluorescent pseudomonads.
