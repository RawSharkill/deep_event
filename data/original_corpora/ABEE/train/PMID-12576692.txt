Functional cloning and expression of emeA, and characterization of EmeA, a  multidrug efflux pump from Enterococcus faecalis. 

A fragment of chromosomal DNA from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was cloned  using Escherichia coli KAM32 host cells lacking major multidrug efflux pumps. E.   coli KAM32 cells were sensitive to many antimicrobial agents, and the transformed  cells harboring a recombinant plasmid became resistant to several structurally  unrelated antimicrobial agents such as tetraphenylphosphonium chloride,  4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Hoechst 33342, acriflavine, benzalkonium  chloride, norfloxacin and ethidium bromide. This suggests that the cloned DNA  fragment carries a gene(s) encoding a multidrug efflux pump. Determination of the  nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA revealed a gene designated as emeA. The  transformed E. coli cells showed efflux activity of several antimicrobial agents   such as DAPI, Hoechst 33342 and acriflavine. Efflux of DAPI via EmeA was strongly  inhibited by reserpine.
