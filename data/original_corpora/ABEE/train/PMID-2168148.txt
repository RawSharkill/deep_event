Quinolone resistance-determining region in the DNA gyrase gyrA gene of  Escherichia coli. 

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gyrA genes of 10 spontaneous  quinolone resistant gyrA mutants of Escherichia coli KL16, including four mutants  examined previously, disclosed that quinolone resistance was caused by a point  mutation within the region between amino acids 67 and 106, especially in the  vicinity of amino acid 83, of the GyrA protein.
