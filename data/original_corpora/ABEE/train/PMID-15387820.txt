MexAB-OprM hyperexpression in NalC-type multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas  aeruginosa: identification and characterization of the nalC gene encoding a  repressor of PA3720-PA3719. 

MexAB-OprM is a multidrug efflux system that contributes to intrinsic and  acquired multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter as a result  of mutational hyperexpression of the mexAB-oprM operon. While efflux gene  hyperexpression typically results from mutations in the linked mexR repressor  gene, it also occurs independently of mexR mutations in so-called nalC mutants  that demonstrate more modest mexAB-oprM expression and, thus, more modest  multidrug resistance than do mexR strains. Using a transposon insertion  mutagenesis approach, nalC mutant strains were selected and the disrupted gene,  PA3721, identified. Amplification and sequencing of this gene from previously  isolated spontaneous nalC mutants revealed the presence of mutations in all  instances and as such, PA3721 has been renamed nalC. PA3721 (nalC) encodes a  probable repressor of the TetR/AcrR family and occurs upstream of an apparent  two-gene operon, PA3720-PA3719, whose expression was negatively regulated by  PA3721. Thus, PA3720-PA3719 was hyperexpressed in transposon insertion and  spontaneous nalC mutants. The loss of PA3719 but not of PA3720 expression in a  spontaneous nalC mutant reduced MexAB-OprM expression to wild-type levels and  compromised multidrug resistance, an indication that hyperexpression of PA3719  only was necessary for the nalC phenotype. Introduction of PA3719 into wild-type   P. aeruginosa on a multicopy plasmid was, in fact, sufficient to promote elevated  MexAB-OprM expression and multidrug resistance characteristic of a nalC strain.  Thus, the nalC (PA3721) mutation serves only to enhance PA3720-PA3719 expression,  with expression of PA3719 (encodes a 53 amino acid protein of predicted pI 10.4)   directly or indirectly impacting MexAB-OprM expression. Intriguingly, nalC  strains produce markedly elevated levels of stable MexR protein suggesting that  PA3720-PA3719 hyperexpression somehow modulates MexR repressor activity. The  deduced products of PA3720-PA3719 show no homology to sequences presently in the   GenBank databases, however, and as such provide no clues as to how this might  occur.
