Two new dfr genes in trimethoprim resistant integron-negative Escherichia coli  isolates. 

Two Escherichia coli isolates resistant to trimethoprim but negative for  integrons carried two new resistance genes, dfrA24 and dfrA26, remotely similar  to one another and to the cassette-independent genes dfrA8 and dfrA9. The dfrA24   gene was not associated with known mobile elements, while dfrA26 was associated  with the CR1 common region.
