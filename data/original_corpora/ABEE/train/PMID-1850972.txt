4-Quinolone resistance mutations in the DNA gyrase of Escherichia coli clinical  isolates identified by using the polymerase chain reaction. 

Seven nalidixic acid resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli were shown  to carry resistance mutations in their gyrase A proteins. Six had serine-83 to  leucine or tryptophan changes; the seventh had an aspartate-87 to valine  substitution. The frequent occurrence of a mutation at serine-83 implies a key  role for this residue in quinolone action.
