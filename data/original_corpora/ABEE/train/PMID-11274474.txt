Sequencing of the ddl gene and modeling of the mutated D-alanine:D-alanine ligase  in glycopeptide dependent strains of Enterococcus faecium. 

Glycopeptide dependence for growth in enterococci results from mutations in the  ddl gene that inactivate the host D-Ala:D-Ala ligase. The strains require  glycopeptides as inducers for synthesis of resistance proteins, which allows for   the production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in D-Ala-D-Lac instead of  D-Ala-D-Ala. The sequences of the ddl gene from nine glycopeptide dependent  Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates were determined. Each one had a mutation  consisting either in a 5-bp insertion at position 41 leading to an early stop  codon, an in-frame 6-bp deletion causing the loss of two residues (KDVA243-246 to  KA), or single base-pair changes resulting in an amino acid substitution (E13 -->  G, G99 --> R, V241 --> D, D295 --> G, P313 --> L). The potential consequences of   the deletion and point mutations on the 3-D structure of the enzyme were  evaluated by comparative molecular modeling of the E. faecium enzyme, using the  X-ray structure of the homologous Escherichia coli D-Ala:D-Ala ligase DdlB as a  template. All mutated residues were found either to interact directly with one of  the substrates of the enzymatic reaction (E13 and D295) or to stabilize the  position of critical residues in the active site. Maintenance of the 3-D  structure in the vicinity of these mutations in the active site appears critical   for D-Ala:D-Ala ligase activity.
