Multidrug resistance in enteric and other gram-negative bacteria. 

In Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug resistance is a term that is used to  describe mechanisms of resistance by chromosomal genes that are activated by  induction or mutation caused by the stress of exposure to antibiotics in natural   and clinical environments. Unlike plasmid-borne resistance genes, there is no  alteration or degradation of drugs or need for genetic transfer. Exposure to a  single drug leads to cross-resistance to many other structurally and functionally  unrelated drugs. The only mechanism identified for multidrug resistance in  bacteria is drug efflux by membrane transporters, even though many of these  transporters remain to be identified. The enteric bacteria exhibit mostly complex  multidrug resistance systems which are often regulated by operons or regulons.  The purpose of this review is to survey molecular mechanisms of multidrug  resistance in enteric and other Gram-negative bacteria, and to speculate on the  origins and natural physiological functions of the genes involved.
