Antibiotic resistance mechanisms of mutant EF-Tu species in Escherichia coli.

Analysis of antibiotic-resistant EF-Tu mutants has revealed a connection between   resistance and structural elements that participate in the GTPase switching  mechanism. Both random and site-directed mutagenesis methods have yielded sets of  purified mutant EF-Tu resistant to kirromycin (kirT) or pulvomycin (pulT). All  kirT mutations cluster in the interface of domain 1 and 3 of EF-Tu in its  GTP-bound conformation, not in that of EF-Tu.GDP. Other evidence also suggests  that kirromycin binds to the interface of wild-type EF-Tu, thereby jamming the  GTPase switch. Various functional studies reveal two subsequent resistance  mechanisms. The first hinders kirromycin binding to EF-Tu.GTP and the second  occurs after GTP hydrolysis by rejection of bound kirromycin. All pulT mutations   cluster in the three-domain junction interface of EF-Tu. GTP (which is an open  hole in EF-Tu.GDP) and destabilize a salt-bridge network. Pulvomycin may bind  nearby and overlap with tRNA binding. Mutations show that a D99-R230 salt bridge   is not essential for the transduction of the GTPase switch signal from domain 1.   In vivo and in vitro studies reveal that pulvomycin sensitivity is dominant over   resistance. This demands a revision of the current view of the mechanism of  pulvomycin inhibition of protein synthesis and may support a translation model  with two EF-Tus on the ribosome. Several mutant EF-Tu species display altered  behaviour towards aminoacyl-tRNA with interesting effects on translational  accuracy. KirT EF-Tu(A375T) is able to reverse the streptomycin dependent  phenotype of a ribosomal protein S12 mutant strain to streptomycin sensitivity.
