Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-negative rods: possible mechanisms.

The literature dealing with the pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-negative rods in   humans is reviewed. Knowledge concerning definite pathogenic mechanisms is, at  best, cursory. There is evidence that encapsulation plays a role in the  pathogenicity of Bacteroides fragilis and some of the black-pigmented  Bacteroides. A range of enzymes, among them collagenase and IgA protease, are  produced by several Bacteroides species. Supernatants of Fusobacterium  necrophorum cultures may be leukotoxic. Synergism between anaerobic gram-negative  rods and other bacterial species has been demonstrated in experimental animals.
