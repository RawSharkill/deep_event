Case report: penicillin resistant pneumococcal meningitis: navigating a  therapeutic minefield.

Pneumococcal meningitis is a common infection in adults for which penicillin has   long been the drug of choice. Optimal treatment has recently become  controversial, however, owing to an alarming increase in the number of  penicillin resistant isolates. The authors report a representative case of  meningitis caused by such an organism, and provide a discussion of the history,  mechanisms of resistance, laboratory evaluation, and treatment of these  infections. Guidelines for prevention are also reviewed, including a renewed call  for utilization of the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
