Tetracyclines: antibiotic action, uptake, and resistance mechanisms.

Tetracyclines probably penetrate bacterial cells by passive diffusion and inhibit  bacterial growth by interfering with protein synthesis or by destroying the  membrane. A growing number of various bacterial species acquire resistance to the  bacteriostatic activity of tetracycline. The two widespread mechanisms of  bacterial resistance do not destroy tetracycline: one is mediated by efflux  pumps, the other involves an EF-G-like protein that confers ribosome protection.   Oxidative destruction of tetracycline has been found in a few species. Several  efflux transporters, including multidrug-resistance pumps and  tetracycline specific exporters, confer bacterial resistance against  tetracycline. Single amino acids of these carrier proteins important for  tetracycline transport and substrate specificity have been identified, allowing  the mechanism of tetracycline transport to begin to emerge.
