The 3-D structure of a zinc metallo-beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus reveals a  new type of protein fold. 

The 3-D structure of Bacillus cereus (569/H/9) beta-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6), which  catalyses the hydrolysis of nearly all beta-lactams, has been solved at 2.5 A  resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method, with density  modification and phase combination, from crystals of the native protein and of a   specially designed mutant (T97C). The current model includes 212 of the 227 amino  acid residues, the zinc ion and 10 water molecules. The protein is folded into a   beta beta sandwich with helices on each external face. To our knowledge, this  fold has never been observed. An approximate internal molecular symmetry is  found, with a 2-fold axis passing roughly through the zinc ion and suggesting a  possible gene duplication. The active site is located at one edge of the beta  beta sandwich and near the N-terminal end of a helix. The zinc ion is coordinated  by three histidine residues (86, 88 and 149) and a water molecule. A sequence  comparison of the relevant metallo-beta-lactamases, based on this protein  structure, highlights a few well-conserved amino acid residues. The structure  shows that most of these residues are in the active site. Among these, aspartic  acid 90 and histidine 210 participate in a proposed catalytic mechanism for  beta-lactam hydrolysis.
