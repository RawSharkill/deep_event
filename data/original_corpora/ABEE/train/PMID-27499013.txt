ATP-dependent substrate transport by the ABC transporter MsbA is proton-coupled. 

ATP-binding cassette transporters mediate the transbilayer movement of a vast  number of substrates in or out of cells in organisms ranging from bacteria to  humans. Current alternating access models for ABC exporters including the  multidrug and Lipid A transporter MsbA from Escherichia coli suggest a role for  nucleotide as the fundamental source of free energy. These models involve cycling  between conformations with inward- and outward-facing substrate-binding sites in   response to engagement and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains.  Here we report that MsbA also utilizes another major energy currency in the cell   by coupling substrate transport to a transmembrane electrochemical proton  gradient. The dependence of ATP-dependent transport on proton coupling, and the  stimulation of MsbA-ATPase by the chemical proton gradient highlight the  functional integration of both forms of metabolic energy. These findings  introduce ion coupling as a new parameter in the mechanism of this homodimeric  ABC transporter.
