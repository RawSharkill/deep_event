Detection of a phylogenetically distinct IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase, IMP-35,  in a CC235 Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the Dutch-German border region (Euregio). 

OBJECTIVES: To characterize a highly divergent IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase  (MBL) variant detected in a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical  isolate. METHODS: P. aeruginosa isolate 1876 was recovered from an anal swab of  an inpatient at a German hospital in the Dutch-German border region (Euregio),  where cross-border patient healthcare occurs. MICs were determined by agar  dilution and phenotypic screening for MBL production by Etest MBL. Typing was  performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PCR assays and nucleotide  sequencing were employed for identification of bla gene types. The class 1  integron carrying the blaIMP-type gene was characterized by PCR mapping and  sequencing using a set of specific primers. A phylogenetic tree was constructed  for the new blaIMP variant. RESULTS: Isolate 1876 was phenotypically positive for  MBL production, exhibited resistance to carbapenems and harboured a new  blaIMP-type gene, blaIMP-35. MLST showed that the allelic profile corresponded to  ST622, which belongs to the prevalent international clonal complex CC235. The  blaIMP-35 gene was located in a class 1 integron as the first gene cassette,  followed by blaOXA-35, aacA6, qacEDelta1 and sul1, suggesting its recent  integration. IMP-35 was highly divergent, possessing 33/246 (13.4%) different  amino acid residues from its closest IMP variants (IMP-8 and IMP-12) and was  phylogenetically distinct, representing a separate group in the phylogenetic tree  of IMP proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of this phylogenetically  distinct IMP-type variant in a CC235 P. aeruginosa suggests the ongoing spread of  new IMP-type carbapenemases as well as the potential of the blaIMP-35 gene to  evolve in the hospital environment.
