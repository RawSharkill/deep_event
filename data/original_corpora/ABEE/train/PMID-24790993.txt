Worldwide dissemination of the NDM-type carbapenemases in Gram-negative bacteria. 

The emergence of one of the most recently described carbapenemases, namely, the  New Delhi metallo-lactamase (NDM-1), constitutes a critical and growingly  important medical issue. This resistance trait compromises the efficacy of almost  all lactams (except aztreonam), including the last resort carbapenems.  Therapeutical options may remain limited mostly to colistin, tigecycline, and  fosfomycin. The main known reservoir of NDM producers is the Indian subcontinent   whereas a secondary reservoir seems to have established the Balkans regions and  the Middle East. Although the spread of bla NDM-like genes (several variants) is   derived mostly by conjugative plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae, this carbapenemase   has also been identified in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Acinetobacter  sp. may play a pivotal role for spreading bla NDM genes for its natural reservoir  to Enterobacteriaceae. Rapid diagnostic techniques (Carba NP test) and screening   of carriers are the cornerstone to try to contain this outbreak which threatens  the efficacy of the modern medicine.
