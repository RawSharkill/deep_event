Mechanisms affecting peplomycin sensitivity of Chinese hamster cell lines.

Chinese hamster lung cell line V79 was ca. 13 times more resistant to peplomycin   (PEP), and 6 times more resistant to bleomycin (BLM)-A2 than Chinese hamster  ovary (CHO) cell line. The natural resistance of V79 cells to PEP or BLM was  attributed to higher levels of BLM hydrolase activity and lower cellular uptake  of the antibiotic. The sensitivity to PEP of a mutant clone CHO/O-2 T-1 was  similar to that of CHO. A hybrid clone of CHO/O-2 T-1 X V79 showed an  intermediate sensitivity to PEP between those of both parental cell lines,  suggesting that the gene responsible for the natural resistance to PEP appears  codominantly in the hybrid. The BLM hydrolase activity of the hybrid was also  found intermediate between those of both parental cells. Mutant clones CHO/O-2  T-5 and CHO/O-2 T-6 were 8.3-9.0 times more sensitive to PEP than CHO cells.  Hybrid clones CHO/O-2 T-5 X V79 and CHO/O-2 T-6 X V79 displayed PEP sensitivity  similar to that of V79, suggesting that the gene responsible for the PEP  supersensitivity (PEPss) behaves recessively in the hybrids. Both PEPss clones  showed levels of BLM hydrolase and cellular uptake of [3H]PEP similar to the  parental CHO cells, suggesting that the PEPss is due to neither BLM hydrolase nor  cellular uptake of the antibiotic. Increased PEP-induced DNA cleavage and  decreased DNA repair in the PEPss clones were demonstrated by alkaline sucrose  density gradient sedimentation method. The results suggest that the PEPss of  these mutant clones is attributed to decreased DNA-repairing activity and/or  increased DNA-breaking activity.
