Detection of NDM-7 in Germany, a new variant of the New Delhi  metallo-beta-lactamase with increased carbapenemase activity. 

OBJECTIVES: This study characterized a new variant of the New Delhi  metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). METHODS: A multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli  isolate was recovered from the wounds, throat and rectum of a Yemeni patient who   presented at the Frankfurt University Hospital in Germany. The presence of  beta-lactamase genes was analysed by PCR and sequencing. The isolate was further   characterized by susceptibility testing, conjugation and transformation assays  and plasmid analysis. RESULTS: The E. coli isolate was resistant to all  beta-lactams including carbapenems. By PCR analysis, the beta-lactamase genes  blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1 and blaNDM were identified. Sequencing revealed a  blaNDM gene that differed from blaNDM-1 by two point mutations at positions 388  (G-->A) and 460 (A-->C) corresponding to amino acid substitutions Asp130Asn and  Met154Leu, respectively. This NDM variant was identified as NDM-7. The blaNDM-7  gene was located on a self-transferable IncX3 plasmid of 60 kb. E. coli TOP10  transformants harbouring NDM-7 showed higher MICs of beta-lactams including  carbapenems compared with transformants harbouring NDM-1. Multilocus sequence  typing analysis revealed that the E. coli isolate belonged to a novel sequence  type (ST599). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel NDM variant in E. coli,   NDM-7, possessing a high ability to hydrolyse beta-lactam antibiotics. Given the   diversity of NDM variants located on self-transferable plasmids found in  different Gram-negative species and isolated in different countries, the blaNDM  gene will most likely efficiently disseminate worldwide.
