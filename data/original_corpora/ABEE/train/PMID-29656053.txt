Novel variant NDM-11 and other NDM-1 variants in multidrug-resistant Escherichia   coli from South India. 

OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem resistance mediated by New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1   (NDM-1) and its variants has caused a major public-health concern worldwide. Here  we report for the first time an Escherichia coli isolate positive for a novel  variant (NDM-11). METHODS: blaNDM genes were investigated in E. coli by PCR and  sequencing, and blaNDM variants were further characterised. The susceptibility  pattern of novel blaNDM-11 towards different antimicrobials was compared with  blaNDM-1 by cloning and expression in E. coli TOP10. RESULTS: A total of 33  carbapenem resistant E. coli isolates were screened by PCR for the presence of  blaNDM, of which 15 (45.5%) were positive. Sequencing of the PCR products  revealed 10 isolates with NDM-1 and 5 isolates with NDM variants (one each of  NDM-4, NDM-8 and NDM-11 and two NDM-5). Other resistance genes, including  blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-15, blaVIM, plasmid-encoded AmpC blaCMY-2 and 16S  methyltransferases (rmtB and rmtC), were also associated with NDM variants in  different combinations. The blaNDM variants were located on a transferable  IncF-type plasmid of >100kb. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that   all five E. coli isolates were unrelated, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)  revealed that they all belonged to ST131. Expression of the blaNDM-1 and  blaNDM-11 genes in E. coli TOP10 showed no significant difference in MICs to  various beta-lactams, including carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines  the spread of NDM variants with other antimicrobial resistance genes in E. coli  in South India. It also describes a novel NDM variant (blaNDM-11) having an  antimicrobial resistance pattern similar to blaNDM-1.
