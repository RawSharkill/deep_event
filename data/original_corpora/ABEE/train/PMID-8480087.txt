Clinical requirements in the treatment of today's respiratory tract infections.

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most frequent infections in man  and lower tract infections account substantially for the overall mortality in  hospitals. Regarding the etiology of pneumonias, one has to consider different  pathogenic mechanisms, age of the patients, underlying diseases, concomitant  medications, symptomatologies, seasonal influences, and clinical conditions, e.g.  intensive care environment and mechanical ventilation. To optimize the rational  management of respiratory infections, identification of the etiologic agent would  be desirable. The decision of how to treat is often based on epidemiologic,  clinical, and radiological assessments. Epidemiologic studies have shown a  pronounced difference in the etiologic spectrum between community- and  hospital-acquired RTIs. In community-acquired pneumonias, pneumococci,  Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella, Mycoplasma and viruses predominate, whereas  in nosocomially acquired pneumonias, Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Klebsiella,  Proteus, Enterobacter as well as Pseudomonas and staphylococci comprise the most   frequent isolates. Empirical therapy has to cover all possible etiologic  pathogens which most likely cause the infection. In addition, an adequate kinetic  profile, e.g. once or twice daily dosing, sufficient pulmonary tissue or fluid  penetration, and acceptable tolerance and costs are prerequisites for optimal  therapy. Drugs of choice for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are  aminobenzylpenicillins or macrolides. Oral cephalosporins exhibit excellent  activity against many bacterial pathogens of typical community-acquired  pneumonia, and are active against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae.
