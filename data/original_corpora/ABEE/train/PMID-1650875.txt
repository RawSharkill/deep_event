Tetrahydrocannabinol treatment suppresses growth restriction of Legionella  pneumophila in murine macrophage cultures.

Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen which readily  grows in human and guinea pig macrophages and in peritoneal exudate macrophages  from A/J mice. Macrophage cultures capable of supporting the growth of Legionella  can be used to test the potency of biologically active substances suspected of  modulating host mechanisms of resistance to infection. Accordingly, this model  was used to evaluate the influence of delta-9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) on  macrophage resistance to infection with an intracellular pathogen. Pretreatment  of the macrophages with THC in the concentration range of 2.5 micrograms/ml (8  microM) to 5.0 micrograms/ml (16 microM) had little if any effect on the ability   of the macrophages to either ingest or support the replication of Legionella.  However, THC treatment of cells following Legionella infection resulted in  increased numbers of bacteria recoverable from the macrophage cultures.  Stimulation of the macrophage cultures with the activating agent  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was effective in reducing the ability of Legionella to  grow in the cells. However, treatment of the LPS activated macrophages with THC  resulted in greater growth of the Legionella in the cultures, indicating that the  drug abolished the LPS induced enhanced resistance. These results demonstrate  that THC treatment of macrophages following infection rather than before  infection with Legionella promotes the replication of the bacteria within the  macrophages. In addition, drug treatment suppresses the growth restricting  potential of macrophages activated by LPS.
