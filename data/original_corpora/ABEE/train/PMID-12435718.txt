Novel variant (bla(VIM-4)) of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene bla(VIM-1) in a  clinical strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

A Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate highly resistant to carbapenems was collected  from a patient with postsurgical cerebrospinal infection in Greece. The isolate  carried a class 1 integron that contained as a sole cassette the gene bla(VIM-4),  a novel variant of bla(VIM-1), with one nucleotide difference resulting in a  Ser-to-Arg change at amino acid position 175 of the VIM-1 enzyme. This is the  first detection of a VIM-1 variant after its appearance in Italy.
