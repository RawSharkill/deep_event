Trehalose dimycolate enhances resistance to infection in neutropenic animals.

Bacterial infections are lethal complications of neutropenia, and antibiotics  alone are inadequate therapy for these infections. Irradiated mice become  severely neutropenic and remain susceptible to infection for 2 to 3 weeks,  depending on the dose and quality of radiation. Some bacterial cell wall  derivatives stimulate nonspecific host defense mechanisms against a variety of  microbes which might cause postirradiation infection. In this study we determined  if the cell wall glycolipid trehalose dimycolate (TDM), derived from  Mycobacterium phlei, or a synthetic preparation of TDM was able to (i) enhance  survival in mice when given before or after lethal doses of 60Co radiation and  (ii) increase nonspecific resistance to postirradiation infection. Treatment with  TDM oil-in-water emulsions and with synthetic TDM significantly enhanced survival  before and after lethal doses of 60Co irradiation. This result correlated with  the ability of TDM to reduce the translocation of intestinal bacteria and to  stimulate hematopoiesis. With respect to nonspecific resistance to infection, TDM  injected 1 h after sublethal irradiation increased resistance to a lethal  Klebsiella pneumoniae challenge (10 50% lethal doses of K. pneumoniae in 30 days   [LD50/30]) 4 or 14 days later. Increasing the dose of K. pneumoniae to 5,000  LD50/30 on day 4 overwhelmed the ability of TDM-treated mice to overcome  infection. However, TDM treatment 1 h postirradiation combined with ceftriaxone  antibiotic therapy (days 5 through 14) enhanced survival, even when the higher  dose of bacteria (5,000 LD50/30) was used. These results indicate that in  irradiated mice, TDM can be used to enhance survival and, as a potent stimulant  of nonspecific resistance to infection in neutropenic mice, can act  synergistically with antibiotic therapy to reduce sepsis and mortality.
