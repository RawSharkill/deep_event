[Changes in sensitivity to penicillin and an increase in virulence in  beta-hemolytic streptococci followed by changes in the clinical picture of  streptococcal syndrome].

According to reports from different geographic areas, the last decade has been  characterised with an increasing number of streptococcal diseases. The new  streptococcal "pathomorphosis" is presented by alteration of adhesive properties   and distribution of various serotypes (domination of M1 and M18 serotypes). It is  also expressed by an increased production of pyrogenic exotoxin and necrotic  factor. As a consequence, apart from increasing incidence of streptococcal  infections, it is observed that the streptococcal syndrome has often grave  prognosis followed with a high percentage of mortality. Also a new clinical  entity is also described; that of Toxic Shock Like Syndrome. The results of  investigation concerning the susceptibility of beta-haemolytic streptococci to  penicillin are encouraging. Penicillin resistant strains are not discovered among  clinical isolates so far. However, the increased percentage of penicillin  tolerant strains, and possibility of induction of penicillin resistance, can be  considered as a serious warning. For that reason, further investigation of the  mechanisms of developing penicillin tolerance and resistance appears to be highly  recommended.
