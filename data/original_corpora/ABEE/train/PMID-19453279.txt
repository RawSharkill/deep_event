Structural and functional aspects of the multidrug efflux pump AcrB. 

The tripartite efflux system AcrA/AcrB/TolC is the main pump in Escherichia coli   for the efflux of multiple antibiotics, dyes, bile salts and detergents. The  inner membrane component AcrB is central to substrate recognition and energy  transduction and acts as a proton/drug antiporter. Recent structural studies show  that homotrimeric AcrB can adopt different monomer conformations representing  consecutive states in an allosteric functional rotation transport cycle. The  conformational changes create an alternate access drug transport tunnel including  a hydrophobic substrate binding pocket in one of the cycle intermediates.
