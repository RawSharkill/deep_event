Identification of a novel metallo-beta-lactamase, CAM-1, in clinical Pseudomonas   aeruginosa isolates from Canada. 

OBJECTIVES: To identify the beta-lactamase responsible for the positive detection  of carbapenemase production in four clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  that were negative by PCR for KPC, OXA-48, NDM, VIM, IMP, GES and NMC/IMI  carbapenemase genes. METHODS: WGS using short-read and long-read methods was used  to characterize the isolates. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify the  potential gene encoding a carbapenemase. Cloning, antimicrobial susceptibility  testing and biochemical and phenotypic characterization were used to determine  metallo-enzyme activity. Single-nucleotide variant (SNV) typing was used to  determine strain relatedness. Conjugation experiments were used to determine  transmissibility of the novel carbapenemase-encoding gene. RESULTS: WGS analysis   revealed a novel class B beta-lactamase gene, blaCAM-1 (Central Alberta  Metallo-beta-lactamase), located in a 73 kb integrative element, named  IMEPaCAM-1, in the chromosome of four clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The  cloned blaCAM-1 gene conferred carbapenem resistance to Escherichia coli TOP10.  The four isolates, which were all closely related, were from three patients, all   of whom spent time in the same hospital in 2008 and/or 2009. IMEPaCAM-1 could not  be transferred by conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: A novel metallo-enzyme, CAM-1, is  encoded on an integrative element, IMEPaCAM-1, located in the chromosome of  clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. No additional isolates harbouring CAM-1 have   been identified in Alberta since 2007.
