In vitro activity of five quinolones and analysis of the quinolone  resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE in Ureaplasma parvum  and Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates from perinatal patients in Japan. 

Ureaplasma spp. cause several disorders, such as nongonococcal urethritis,  miscarriage, and preterm delivery with lung infections in neonates, characterized  by pathological chorioamnionitis in the placenta. Although reports on antibiotic   resistance in Ureaplasma are on the rise, reports on quinolone resistant  Ureaplasma infections in Japan are limited. The purpose of this study was to  determine susceptibilities to five quinolones of Ureaplasma urealyticum and  Ureaplasma parvum isolated from perinatal samples in Japan and to characterize  the quinolone resistance-determining regions in the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE  genes. Out of 28 clinical Ureaplasma strains, we isolated 9 with high MICs of  quinolones and found a single parC gene mutation, resulting in the change S83L.  Among 158 samples, the ParC S83L mutation was found in 37 samples (23.4%),  including 1 sample harboring a ParC S83L-GyrB P462S double mutant. Novel  mutations of ureaplasmal ParC (S83W and S84P) were independently found in one of   the samples. Homology modeling of the ParC S83W mutant suggested steric hindrance  of the quinolone binding pocket (QBP), and de novo prediction of peptide  structures revealed that the ParC S84P may break/kink the formation of the alpha4  helix in the QBP. Further investigations are required to unravel the extent and  mechanism of antibiotic resistance of Ureaplasma spp. in Japan.
