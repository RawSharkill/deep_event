DnaA protein interacts with RNA polymerase and partially protects it from the  effect of rifampicin. 

The Escherichia coli DnaA protein forms an oligomer at the origin and initiates  chromosome replication with the aid of architectural elements and transcription  by RNA polymerase. Rifampicin inhibits initiation of transcription by RNA  polymerase and thus also initiation of replication. Here, we report that  wild-type cells undergo rifampicin resistant initiation of replication during  slow growth in acetate medium. The rifampicin resistant initiation was prevented   by reducing the availability of DnaA. In vitro experiments showed that the DnaA  protein interacted with RNA polymerase and that it afforded a partial protection   from the negative effect of rifampicin. It is possible that rifampicin resistant   rounds of replication occur when a surplus of DnaA is available at the origin. In  rich medium wild-type cells do not exhibit rifampicin resistant rounds of  replication, possibly indicating that there is no surplus DnaA, and that DnaA  activity is the factor limiting the process of initiation. During growth in  acetate medium, on the contrary, DnaA activity is not limiting in the same way  because an initiation potential is present and can be turned into extra rounds of  replication when rifampicin is added. The result suggests that regulation of  replication initiation may differ at different growth rates.
