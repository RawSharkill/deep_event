DNA and protein interactions in the regulation of plasmid replication.

As for bacterial and animal viruses that employ different mechanisms for their  duplication in a host cell, plasmids have evolved different strategies to assure   their hereditary stability or maintenance at a specific copy number during cell  growth and division. A characteristic feature of plasmid replication control,  however, is an involvement of one or more negatively controlling elements.  Furthermore, a majority of the bacterial plasmids examined to date contain direct  nucleotide sequence repeats at their origin of replication and encode a  replication protein that binds to these repeat sequences. The binding of the  replication protein (pi protein) specified by the antibiotic resistance plasmid  R6K to a set of 22 base pair direct nucleotide sequence repeats is required for  the initiation of replication at each of three origins of replication (alpha,  beta and gamma) within a 4 Kb segment of R6K. The pi initiation protein is  multifunctional in that it has both positive and negative activities in both  controlling the initiation of replication and autoregulating its own synthesis.  Similarly, the direct repeats of plasmid R6K and several other plasmid systems  play more than one role in plasmid replication. These repeats, termed iterons,  are not only required for origin activity but also exert a negative effect on  plasmid copy number possibly as a result of their 'titration' of a plasmid  encoded replication protein. The properties of plasmid replication proteins and  direct nucleotide sequence repeats that are important for their opposing positive  and negative roles in the regulation of the initiation of replication are  described with particular emphasis on plasmid R6K of Escherichia coli.
