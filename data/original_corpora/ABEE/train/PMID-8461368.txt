[Resistance in Haemophilus influenzae in Spain. 2d study (1990)].

AIM: To study the resistance to strains of H. influenzae simultaneously isolated   during 1990 in 10 Spanish cities with this being the second multicentric study  carried out in Spain. METHODS: Three hundred eight strains of H. influenzae were   consecutively isolated with less than 50% being from the respiratory tract. The  sensitivity by microdilution in supplement Isosensitest was studied. RESULTS:  Thirty-five percent of the strains were producers of beta-lactamase which  predominate among those isolated in systemic infections and specially among those  from Madrid (58.78%) and Barcelona (61.8%). The strains producing beta-lactamase   were more resistant to all the antimicrobials than the non producers. Five point   two percent of the strains were resistant to ampicillin by non enzymatic  mechanisms. Resistance to chloramphenicol is frequent (28.6%) especially among  strains producing beta-lactamase, strains of ocular origin and ORL (46%) and  systemic infections (74.3%). The distribution is irregular, being more frequent  in Seville (66.7%) and not detectable in Barcelona. Resistance to tetracycline is  also usually linked to the production of beta-lactamase and not necessarily to  that of chloramphenicol. Resistance to cotrimoxazole is the most frequent (67.5%)  specially in Valladolid (87.5%). Resistance to cefaclor is of 60.7% being the  most frequent among those isolated from ocular processes and ORL. Only 28 strains  (9.1%) were sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested. Thirty-nine percent were   multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found a slight increase in the high  resistance detected in 1986. This increase was not uniform in all of Spain being   significant in Madrid with producers of beta-lactamase, in Seville to  chloramphenicol, to tetracycline in Bilbao and cotrimoxazole in Valencia.
