Whole-Genome Analysis of an Extensively Drug-Resistance Empedobacter falsenii  Strain Reveals Distinct Features and the Presence of a Novel Metallo-ss-Lactamase  (EBR-2). 

The spread of antibiotic resistance is rapidly threatening the effectiveness of  antibiotics in the clinical setting. Many infections are being caused by known  and unknown pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to many or all antibiotics  currently available. Empedobacter falsenii is a nosocomial pathogen that can  cause human infections. E. falsenii Wf282 strain was found to be resistant to  many antibiotics, including carbapenems and colistin. Whole-genome shotgun  sequencing of the strain was performed, and distinct features were identified. A   novel metallo-beta-lactamase, named EBR-2, was found, suggesting a potential role  of E. falsenii as a reservoir of beta-lactamases and other resistance  determinants also found in its genome. The EBR-2 protein showed the highest  catalytic efficiency for penicillin G as compared to meropenem and ampicillin and  was unable to hydrolyze cefepime. The results described in this work broaden the   current understanding of the role of beta-lactamases in the Flavobacteriaceae  family and suggest that E. falsenii Wf282 may be a reservoir of these novel  resistance determinants.
