Bacterial genetic exchange in nature.

Most bacteria are haploid organisms containing only one copy of each gene per  cell for most of the growth cycle. This means that the chance for correcting  random mutations in bacterial genes would depend entirely on the complementarity   inherent in DNA structures, unless homologous DNA sequences can be imported from   outside the cell. Bacteria, like all living organisms have evolved at least one  autonomous mechanism, conjugation, for exchanging portions of genetic materials  between two related cells. The ecological benefits of conjugation include the  expansion of metabolic versatility and resistance to hazardous environmental  conditions. Natural bacterial genetic exchange also occurs through virus  infections (transduction) and through the uptake of extracellular DNA  (transformation). The origin and ecological benefits of transduction and  transformation are difficult to assess because they are driven by factors  external to the affected cell. Bacterial genetic exchange has implications for  the evolution of phenotypes that are either beneficial to humans, such as  biodegradation of toxic xenobiotic chemicals, or that are detrimental, such as  the evolution of pathogenesis and the spread of antibiotic resistance.  Understanding natural bacterial genetic exchange mechanisms is also relevant to  the assessment of dispersal risks associated with genetically engineered bacteria  and recombinant genes in the environment.
