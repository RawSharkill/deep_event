Molecular events in adipocyte development. 

Adipocyte hyperplasia occurs by the proliferation and differentiation of  adipocyte precursor cells or preadipocytes. Although the process of commitment to  the adipocyte lineage is poorly understood, a great deal of information has  accumulated about the processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in  preadipocyte differentiation. The differentiation of preadipocytes is known to be  characterized by increased transcription of a number of specific genes. AP-1 and   C/EBP binding sites within these genes have been identified as important  regulatory sequences. In addition, a specific enhancer sequence has been shown to  confer adipose tissue specificity. This article will review the changes in gene  transcription that occur during preadipocyte differentiation and how these are  regulated. The potential role of autocrine/paracrine acting factors in the  proliferation and differentiation of the preadipocyte is also discussed.
