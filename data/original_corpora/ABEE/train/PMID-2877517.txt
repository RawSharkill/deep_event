Pathogenesis of urinary tract infections. Bacterial adherence, bladder defense  mechanisms.

Bacterial virulence depends upon the ability of bacteria to adhere to mucosal  cells. The risk of infection is increased by bacterial factors promoting this  adherence and the fact that bacterial surface structures seek epithelial  receptors. The host's ability to inactivate bacterial virulence factors and to  "mask" its own cell receptors determines whether infections are to be warded off   successfully. The current knowledge of these processes is reviewed in this  article.
