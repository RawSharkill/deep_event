The role of colonization in the pathogenesis of nosocomial infections.

The close relationship between colonization and the development of nosocomial  infections has been demonstrated. Patient-related factors, such as underlying  illness for all major sites of infection and advanced age, and pathogen-related  factors, such as the ability of bacteria to adhere to epithelial cells, play the   major roles in the pathogenesis of colonization. However, exact mechanisms of  colonization have not been elucidated, and modulation of bacterial adherence as a  method of infection prevention remains experimental. Current methods of infection  prevention, therefore, focus either on preventing growth of colonizing  microorganisms or on preventing patient-pathogen contact. Topical antibiotics  have been used as a method of colonization prevention. However, their  effectiveness may be limited by increases in antibiotic resistance; moreover, the  effects of patient outcome are controversial. Maintenance of the physiologic  mucosal environment using nonantimicrobial agents seems a promising approach, but  only a few studies demonstrating efficacy have been published. Prevention of  colonization still must rely heavily on basic infection control measures to  prevent contact between patient and pathogen.
