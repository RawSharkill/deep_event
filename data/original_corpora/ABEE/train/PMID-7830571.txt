Observations on the formation of deletions on monomeric and dimeric plasmids in  Escherichia coli.

We have studied the formation of spontaneous mutations on plasmids present in the  monomeric and dimeric states in a recF strain of Escherichia coli. Two test  systems were employed: (i) the precise excision of Tn5 from the tetA gene of the   plasmid pBR322 and (ii) operator constitutive (Oc) mutations on the  pBR322-derived plasmid pPY97. The rate of Oc mutations was increased by a factor   of three when this plasmid was present in the dimeric state compared to the  monomeric state and the Oc phenotype was caused by small deletions in the  operator sequence. No apparent mutational hot-spot was found. The rate of Tn5  excision was increased on dimeric compared to monomeric plasmids. Excision from a  dimeric plasmid usually resulted in two types of mutant plasmids; a dimeric  plasmid, where the Tn5 had excised from one of the plasmid units, and a monomeric  parental pBR322. A mechanisms to account for this is suggested. Complementation  tests revealed that the increased mutation rate on dimeric plasmids is the result  of dimers being mutaphilic per se, rather than the result of a general,  trans-acting increase in mutation rates of the host, induced by the presence of  the dimeric plasmid. Furthermore, it was found that the rate of Tn5 excision from  plasmids in the monomeric state was increased when the region carrying the  inserted Tn5 was duplicated.
