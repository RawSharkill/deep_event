An emerging consensus for the structure of EmrE. 

The archetypical member of the small multidrug-resistance family is EmrE, a  multidrug transporter that extrudes toxic polyaromatic cations from the cell  coupled to the inward movement of protons down a concentration gradient. The  architecture of EmrE was first defined from the analysis of two-dimensional  crystals by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), which showed that EmrE was an  unusual asymmetric dimer formed from a bundle of eight alpha-helices. The most  favoured interpretation of the structure was that the monomers were oriented in  opposite orientations in the membrane in an antiparallel orientation. A model was  subsequently built based upon the cryo-EM data and evolutionary constraints and  this model was consistent with mutagenic data indicating which amino-acid  residues were important for substrate binding and transport. Two X-ray structures  that differed significantly from the cryo-EM structure were subsequently  retracted owing to a data-analysis error. However, the revised X-ray structure  with substrate bound is extremely similar to the model built from the cryo-EM  structure (r.m.s.d. of 1.4 A), suggesting that the proposed antiparallel  orientation of the monomers is indeed correct; this represents a new structural  paradigm in membrane-protein structures. The vast majority of mutagenic and  biochemical data corroborate this structure, although cross-linking studies and  recent EPR data apparently support a model of EmrE that contains parallel dimers.
