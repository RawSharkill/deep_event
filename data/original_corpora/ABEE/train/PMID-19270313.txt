Identification of bla(IMP-22) in Pseudomonas spp. in urban wastewater and  nosocomial environments: biochemical characterization of a new IMP metallo-enzyme  variant and its genetic location. 

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was the biochemical characterization of a new  variant of the metallo-beta-lactamase, IMP-22. Moreover, the genetic environment   of the bla(IMP-22) gene was investigated in Pseudomonas fluorescens and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from urban wastewater and a teaching hospital in  L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: Molecular characterization of genetic elements was  carried out by PCR and DNA sequencing methods. The new enzyme was purified from  recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE)Rosetta/pBC-SK/IMP-22. Steady-state kinetic   parameters (K(m) and V(max)) were determined for a large pattern of substrates.  RESULTS: A new IMP metallo-beta-lactamase gene was found in a class 1 integron  and in one case, in a plasmid of Pseudomonas spp. The bla(IMP-22) encodes for a  pre-protein of 246 amino acids and the N-terminus of the mature beta-lactamase  (NH(2)-PDLK) was also determined. The molecular mass and pI were 24 930 Da and  6.2, respectively. On the basis of the kinetic parameters calculated (K(m) and  V(max)), IMP-22 was found to hydrolyse narrow- and extended-spectrum  beta-lactams. Enzyme activity was found to be inhibited by metal chelators such  as EDTA, 1,10-o-phenathroline and dipicolinic acid with an IC(50) of 800, 750 and  300 microM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the bla(IMP-22) gene in P.   fluorescens environmental strains and P. aeruginosa clinical isolate suggests the  ongoing spread of bla(MBL) genes in several bacterial species and in different  environments.
