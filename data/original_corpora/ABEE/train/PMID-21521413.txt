A novel VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM-14) in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa  clinical isolate from a neonatal intensive care unit. 

A Pseudomonas aeruginosa highly resistant to carbapenems was isolated in a  neonatal intensive care unit in Palermo, Italy. The strain was found to carry a  novel VIM-type enzyme, classified as VIM-14. The novel enzyme differs from VIM-4   in a G31S mutation. VIM-14 was harboured in a class 1 integron with a new  organization. The integron carried the genes aac7, blaVIM-14, blaOXA-20 and aac4   in that order.
