pHH502, a plasmid with IncP and IncI alpha characters, loses the latter by a  specific recA-independent deletion event.

Plasmid pHH502, of molecular weight 70 X 10(6), determined resistance to  tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulphonamides and mercuric chloride   and was incompatible with members of IncP and IncI alpha. It resembled other  plasmids of IncI alpha in the following properties: it determined pili that were   morphologically and serologically I alpha pili, whose production was repressed in  established plasmid-carrying (R+) cultures; its transfer was equally efficient in  liquid or on solid medium; it exerted surface exclusion against other IncI alpha   plasmids; it was non-transferable to Proteus. In a reproducible, recA-independent  event, pHH502 gave rise to pHH502-1, a plasmid of molecular weight 40 X 10(6),  lacking determinants for resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol and all  detectable IncI alpha characteristics. pHH502-1 was incompatible only with IncP  plasmids and resembled other IncP plasmids in determining constitutive production  of rigid pili, in its surface exclusion, in transferring at greater frequency on   solid than in liquid medium and in being transmissible to Proteus mirabilis. It  differed from other IncP plasmids in the morphology and serological type of its  pili and in failing to transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter  calcoaceticus. Small numbers of pHH502-1 rigid pili were present on bacteria  carrying pHH502. Possible mechanisms for the generation of pHH502 and pHH502-1  are discussed.
