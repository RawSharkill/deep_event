Purification of the Tn10-specified tetracycline efflux antiporter TetA in a  native state as a polyhistidine fusion protein. 

The bacterial tetracycline resistance determinant from Tn10 encodes a 43 kDa  membrane protein, TetA, responsible for active efflux of tetracyclines. The tetA   gene was cloned behind a T7 promoter/lac operator in a plasmid that provided  fusion of TetA to a polyhistidine-carboxy terminal tail. A second plasmid  provided a regulated T7 RNA polymerase. The specific activity of the TetA fusion   protein was between 10-40% that of the wild-type protein as assayed by  tetracycline resistance in cells and by transport in membrane vesicles. The  fusion protein, overproduced approximately 3-13-fold, was purified by nickel  chelation chromatography. Calculations from circular dichroism spectra of the  purified protein solubilized in dodecylmaltoside gave an alpha-helix content of  54-64%, close to the 68% predicted from the amino acid sequence by hydropathy  analysis (12 membrane-spanning helices) for the native protein in the membrane  bilayer. Fluorescence studies showed binding activity of the purified protein to   its substrate, the tetracycline analogue  13-(cyclopentylthio)-5-hydroxy-6-alpha-deoxytetracycline. These findings  suggested that the purified protein was in a native state.
