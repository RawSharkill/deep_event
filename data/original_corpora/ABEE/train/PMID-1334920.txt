Natural genetic engineering in evolution.

The results of molecular genetics have frequently been difficult to explain by  conventional evolutionary theory. New findings about the genetic conservation of   protein structure and function across very broad taxonomic boundaries, the mosaic  structure of genomes and genetic loci, and the molecular mechanisms of genetic  change all point to a view of evolution as involving the rearrangement of basic  genetic motifs. A more detailed examination of how living cells restructure their  genomes reveals a wide variety of sophisticated biochemical systems responsive to  elaborate regulatory networks. In some cases, we know that cells are able to  accomplish extensive genome reorganization within one or a few cell generations.   The emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a contemporary example of  evolutionary change; molecular analysis of this phenomenon has shown that it  occurs by the addition rearrangement of resistance determinants and genetic  mobility systems rather than by gradual modification of pre-existing cellular  genomes. In addition, bacteria and other organisms have intricate repair systems   to prevent genetic change by sporadic physicochemical damage or errors of the  replication machinery. In their ensemble, these results show that living cells  have (and use) the biochemical apparatus to evolve by a genetic engineering  process. Future research will reveal how well the regulatory systems integrate  genomic change into basic life processes during evolution.
