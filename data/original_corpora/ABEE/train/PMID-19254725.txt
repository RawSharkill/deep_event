Crystal structure of the periplasmic component of a tripartite macrolide specific  efflux pump. 

In Gram-negative bacteria, type I protein secretion systems and tripartite drug  efflux pumps have a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) as an essential  component. MFPs bridge the outer membrane factor and an inner membrane  transporter, although the oligomeric state of MFPs remains unclear. The most  characterized MFP AcrA connects the outer membrane factor TolC and the  resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux transporter AcrB, which is a major  multidrug efflux pump in Escherichia coli. MacA is the periplasmic MFP in the  MacAB-TolC pump, where MacB was characterized as a macrolide-specific  ATP-binding-cassette-type efflux transporter. Here, we report the crystal  structure of E. coli MacA and the experimentally phased map of Actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans MacA, which reveal a domain orientation of MacA different  from that of AcrA. Notably, a hexameric assembly of MacA was found in both  crystals, exhibiting a funnel-like structure with a central channel and a conical  mouth. The hexameric MacA assembly was further confirmed by electron microscopy  and functional studies in vitro and in vivo. The hexameric structure of MacA  provides insight into the oligomeric state in the functional complex of the drug   efflux pump and type I secretion system.
