[Nosocomial infections: new agents, incidence, prevention].

Nosocomial infection is one of the major health problems confronting clinicians  in intensive care units. Incidence has been estimated to vary from 5 to 10%,  leading to death in one of every 5000 persons hospitalized. This situation is not  however static since hospital epidemics and nosocomial infections evolve as a  consequence of advances in antibiotic drug therapy and surgical and intensive  care techniques. Microbial investigations themselves are of major importance as  the collection of epidemiological data and its communication to hospital partners  affects their approach to patient management. Nosocomial pneumonia, particularly   in ventilated patients, urinary infection in those with indwelling catheters and   wound colonization after surgery are still major problems and explain part of the  variations between wards and hospitals. The main changes concern the bacteria  involved. Classical agents with new mechanisms of resistance (Klebsiella  pneumoniae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers) have been joined by other  "new" agents emerging as pathogens (Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter  baumannii). The incidence of resistance in Staphylococcus and Enterococcus  strains as well as new Gram positive species including Corynebacterium jeikeium  and Rhodococcus equi, now recognized as opportunistic agents, has also increased.  The multiresistance of these pathogens is often responsible for failure of  antibiotic therapy and emphasizes the need both for rigorous prevention through  active cooperation between bacteriologists, ward clinicians and intensive care  units, and further research in the fields of microbial resistance mechanisms and   antibiotics. Preventive measures have become a priority creating an international  challenge to health care policy makers.
