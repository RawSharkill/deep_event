Di-tripeptides and oligopeptides are taken up via distinct transport mechanisms  in Lactococcus lactis.

Lactococcus lactis ML3 possesses two different peptide transport systems of which  the substrate size restriction and specificity have been determined. The first  system is the earlier-described proton motive force-dependent di-tripeptide  carrier (E. J. Smid, A. J. M. Driessen, and W. N. Konings, J. Bacteriol.  171:292-298, 1989). The second system is a metabolic energy-dependent  oligopeptide transport system which transports peptides of four to at least six  amino acid residues. The involvement of a specific oligopeptide transport system   in the utilization of tetra-alanine and penta-alanine was established in a mutant  of L. lactis MG1363 that was selected on the basis of resistance to toxic analogs  of alanine and alanine-containing di- and tripeptides. This mutant is unable to  transport alanine, dialanine, and trialanine but still shows uptake of  tetra-alanine and penta-alanine. The oligopeptide transport system has a lower  activity than the di-tripeptide transport system. Uptake of oligopeptides occurs   in the absence of a proton motive force and is specifically inhibited by  vanadate. The oligopeptide transport system is most likely driven by ATP or a  related energy-rich, phosphorylated intermediate.
