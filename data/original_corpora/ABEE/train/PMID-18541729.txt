Identification of mutations related to streptomycin resistance in clinical  isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and possible involvement of efflux  mechanism. 

The MIC for streptomycin in the presence of efflux pump (EP) inhibitors and the  sequencing of rpsL, rrs, and gidB genes provided evidence for the possible  participation of EP in low-level streptomycin (STR) resistance of some isolates  without mutations. Mutation in the gidB gene and an EP could act synergistically   to confer low STR resistance.
