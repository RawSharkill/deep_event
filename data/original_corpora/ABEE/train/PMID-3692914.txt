Combined application of low temperature preparation and electron microscopic  autoradiography for the localization of systemic fungicides.

The intracellular localization of the sterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (SBI)  fungicide (3H)triadimenol A is investigated in vitro in the fungus Ustilago  avenae. For this purpose low temperature preparation techniques (shock freezing,   freeze substitution, embedding in Lowicryl HM20) are combined with conventional  electron microscopic (EM) autoradiography. In particular the suitability of  Lowicryl HM20 embedded specimens for EM autoradiography with regard to the  finestructure preservation is shown. For the localization of (3H)triadimenol the   filamentous grain development as well as the application of the gold  latensification method resulting in the appearance of spherical silver grains is   tested. Fungicide sensitive wild type sporidia of U. avenae are compared with  fungicide resistant cells of the mutant r8. A quantitative analysis of the  autoradiographs of the wild type developed according to the gold latensification   process shows a relatively homogeneous distribution of silver grains over the  entire cell. On the other hand, the resistant mutant is characterized by an  accumulation of silver deposits over the vacuoles as compared with the lower  density of grains over the cell walls and cytoplasm. The data are discussed in  the context of possible resistance mechanisms against SBI-fungicides.
