[Epidemiology of the distribution of genes coding for resistance to antibiotics].

The increasing prevalence of isolated bacteria resistant to antibiotics is one of  the serious problems of contemporary clinical medicine because it is the main  cause of failing treatment of infectious diseases. Therefore great efforts are  made to reveal the mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics and to elucidate their  epidemiology. In the submitted paper the author summarizes the present stage of  knowledge concerning mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics and mechanisms of  their distribution in nature. In the conclusion the authors draw attention to the  important character of transmitted resistance to antibiotics from the aspect of  its rapid spread among the microbial population.
