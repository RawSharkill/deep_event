[Gnotobiotic studies to determine the colonization resistance of the intestines].

The literature data and the results of the author studies on determination of  intestine colonization resistance are presented. The mechanisms of the  colonization resistance defined by the macroorganism factors and representatives   of indigenic microflora are discussed. The results of the experiments with animal  gnotobiotes aimed at elucidating new aspects of the colonization resistance  mechanism: antagonistic interrelations between pathogenic and nonpathogenic  bacteria and the role of transitory microflora, factors lowering the colonization  resistance are presented. The up-to-date methods for testing the colonization  resistance and the ways for its increasing are indicated.
