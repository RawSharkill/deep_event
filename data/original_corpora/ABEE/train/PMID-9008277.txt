Mycobacterium tuberculosis efpA encodes an efflux protein of the QacA transporter  family. 

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv efpA gene encodes a putative efflux protein,  EfpA, of 55,670 Da. The deduced EfpA protein was similar in secondary structure  to Pur8, MmrA, TcmA, LfrA, EmrB, and other members of the QacA transporter family  (QacA TF) which mediate antibiotic and chemical resistance in bacteria and yeast.  The predicted EfpA sequence possessed all transporter motifs characteristic of  the QacA TF, including those associated with proton-antiport function and the  motif considered to be specific to exporters. The 1,590-bp efpA open reading  frame was G+C rich (65%), whereas the 40-bp region immediately upstream had an  A+T bias (35% G+C). Reverse transcriptase-PCR assays indicated that efpA was  expressed in vitro and in situ. Putative promoter sequences were partially  overlapped by the A+T-rich region and by a region capable of forming alternative   secondary structures indicative of transcriptional regulation in analogous  systems. PCR single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis demonstrated  that these upstream flanking sequences and the 231-bp, 5' coding region are  highly conserved among both drug-sensitive and multiply-drug-resistant isolates  of M. tuberculosis. The efpA gene was present in the slow-growing human pathogens  M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Mycobacterium bovis and in the  opportunistic human pathogens Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium  intracellular. However, efpA was not present in 17 other opportunistically  pathogenic or nonpathogenic mycobacterial species.
