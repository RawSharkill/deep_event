[Basic aspects of Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA--typing and extracellular toxins  and proteins].

Many kinds of staphylococcal typing systems have been developed and tested for  epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase typing and phage typing are more  useful and important for this epidemiology. The methods of coagulase typing and  phage typing were discussed in this paper. A large number of toxins and proteins   of Staphylococcus aureus have been released in the field of infectious  environment. Some of these toxins and proteins, working as causative agents of  staphylococcal infection, are of interest and discussed here. MRSA shows the same  mechanisms of infection as methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
