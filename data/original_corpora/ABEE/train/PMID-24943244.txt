OmpU as a biomarker for rapid discrimination between toxigenic and epidemic  Vibrio cholerae O1/O139 and non-epidemic Vibrio cholerae in a modified MALDI-TOF   MS assay. 

BACKGROUND: Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae.  Outbreaks are caused by a genetically homogenous group of strains from serogroup   O1 or O139 that are able to produce the cholera toxin. Rapid detection and  identification of these epidemic strains is essential for an effective response  to cholera outbreaks. RESULTS: The use of ferulic acid as a matrix in a new  MALDI-TOF MS assay increased the measurable mass range of existing MALDI-TOF MS  protocols for bacterial identification. The assay enabled rapid discrimination  between epidemic V. cholerae O1/O139 strains and other less pathogenic V.  cholerae strains. OmpU, an outer membrane protein whose amino acid sequence is  highly conserved among epidemic strains of V. cholerae, appeared as a  discriminatory marker in the novel MALDI-TOF MS assay. CONCLUSIONS: The extended   mass range of MALDI-TOF MS measurements obtained by using ferulic acid improved  the screening for biomarkers in complex protein mixtures. Differences in the mass  of abundant homologous proteins due to variation in amino acid sequences can  rapidly be examined in multiple samples. Here, a rapid MALDI-TOF MS assay was  developed that could discriminate between epidemic O1/O139 strains and other less  pathogenic V. cholerae strains based on differences in mass of the OmpU protein.   It appeared that the amino acid sequence of OmpU from epidemic V. cholerae  O1/O139 strains is unique and highly conserved.
