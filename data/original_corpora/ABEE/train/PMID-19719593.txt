Occurrence of integron-associated resistance gene cassettes located on antibiotic  resistance plasmids isolated from a wastewater treatment plant.

The role of a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a reservoir for bacteria  carrying antibiotic resistance plasmids was analysed. Altogether, ninety-seven  different multiresistance plasmids were isolated and screened by PCR for the  presence of class 1 integron-specific sequences. Twelve of these plasmids were  identified to carry integrons. In addition, integron-specific sequences were  found on plasmid-DNA preparations from bacteria residing in activated sludge and   in the final effluents of the wastewater treatment plant. Sequencing and  annotation of the integrons identified nineteen different gene cassette arrays,  containing twenty-one different resistance gene cassettes. These cassettes carry   genes encoding eight different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, seven  dihydrofolate reductases, three beta-lactamases, two chloramphenicol resistance  proteins and two small exporter proteins. Moreover, new gene cassettes and  cassettes with unknown function were identified. Eleven gene cassette  combinations are described for the first time. Six integron-associated gene  cassette arrays are located on self-transmissible, putative broad-host-range  plasmids belonging to the IncP group. Hybridisation analyses, using the  integron-specific gene cassette arrays as templates and labelled plasmid-DNA  preparations from bacteria of the final effluents as hybridisation probes,  revealed that bacteria containing integron-specific sequences on plasmids are  released into the environment.
