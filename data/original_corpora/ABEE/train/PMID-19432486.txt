Crystal structure of the periplasmic region of MacB, a noncanonic ABC  transporter. 

MacB is a noncanonic ABC-type transporter within Gram-negative bacteria, which is  responsible both for the efflux of macrolide antibiotics and for the secretion of  heat-stable enterotoxin II. In Escherichia coli, MacB requires the membrane  fusion protein MacA and the multifunctional outer membrane channel TolC to pump  substrates to the external medium. Sequence analysis of MacB suggested that MacB   has a relatively large periplasmic region. To gain insight into how MacB  assembles with MacA and TolC, we determined the crystal structure of the  periplasmic region of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans MacB. Fold matching  program reveals that parts of the MacB periplasmic region have structural motifs   in common with the RND-type transporter AcrB. Since it behaved as a monomer in  solution, our finding is consistent with the dimeric nature of full-length MacB,   providing an insight into the assembly in the tripartite efflux pump.
