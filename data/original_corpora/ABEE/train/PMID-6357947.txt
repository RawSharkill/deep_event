[Expression of the amino acid operons in Escherichia coli strains with an altered  transcription and translation apparatus. III. The effect of mutations in the rpoB  gene coding for the beta-subunit of RNA-poly-merase on ilv-operon expression].

The influence of rifampicin resistance mutations on expression of the ilv operon   of Escherichia coli was investigated. Some of these mutations, like those  previously described in our works, occur in translation machinery of E. coli and   inhibit derepression of the ilv operon. However, another group of mutations  stimulated the expression of the operon when mutated cells were transferred from   rich to minimal growth medium. The possible mechanisms of the effects of  rifampicin resistance mutations on the action of coupled  transcription--translation system are discussed.
