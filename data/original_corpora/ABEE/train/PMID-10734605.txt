Complete nucleotide sequence of the prophage VT2-Sakai carrying the verotoxin 2  genes of the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 derived from the Sakai  outbreak. 

The enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952,  derived from an outbreak in Sakai city, Japan, in 1996, produces two kinds of  verotoxins, VT1 and VT2, encoded by the stx1 and stx2 genes. In the EHEC strains,  as well as in other VT-producing E. coli strains, the toxins are encoded by  lysogenic bacteriophages. The EHEC O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952 did not produce  plaque-forming phage particles upon inducing treatments. We have determined the  complete nucleotide sequence of a prophage, VT2-Sakai, carrying the stx2A and  stx2B genes on the chromosome, and presumed the putative functions of the encoded  proteins and the cis-acting DNA elements based on sequence homology data. To our   surprise, the sequences in the regions of VT2-Sakai corresponding to the early  gene regulators and replication proteins, and the DNA sequences recognized by the  regulators share very limited homology to those of the VT2-encoding 933W phage  carried by the EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 reported by Plunkett et al. (J.  Bacteriol., p1767-1778, 181, 1999), although the sequences corresponding to the  structural components are almost identical. These data suggest that these two  phages were derived from a common ancestral phage and that either or both of them  underwent multiple genetic rearrangements. An IS629 insertion was found  downstream of the stx2B gene and upstream of the lysis gene S, and this might be   responsible for the absence of plaque-forming activity in the lysate obtained  after inducing treatments.
