Partial characterization of Serratia marcescens nosocomial strains.

A nosocomial infection outbreak occurred in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the   Instituto Nacional de Pediatria (INP) in Mexico City, during the months of March,  April and May in 1988 Serratia marcescens was isolated as the etiological agent  for this epidemic. Up to date, the source of contamination, the spreading and the  pathogenic mechanisms which were involved in this outbreak remain unknown. In  order to study the dynamics of the bacterial population involved in this  outbreak, all strains of nosocomial S. marcescens isolated during 1988 were  collected and studied. Eighty nosocomial strains were analysed. For this purpose   we used four different markers: antibiotic susceptibility, presence of plasmids,   exoenzyme production and pigment synthesis from a precursor. Using these markers,  we were able to establish that five subpopulations of bacteria were present  during the ICU outbreak, and that one of these subpopulations, VIII-A, was the  most frequently isolated. A short time after this outbreak, we obtained S.  marcescens isolates with similar properties which proceeded from other hospital  units, suggesting intrahospital dissemination of the strain in question. We  believe that, eventually, this study will allow us to establish bacterial  spreading models within our institution.
