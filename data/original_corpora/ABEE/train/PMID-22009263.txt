The CphAII protein from Aquifex aeolicus exhibits a metal-dependent  phosphodiesterase activity. 

The CphAII protein from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus shows the five  conserved motifs of the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) superfamily and presents 28%  identity with the Aeromonas hydrophila subclass B2 CphA MBL. The gene encoding  CphAII was amplified by PCR from the A. aeolicus genomic DNA and overexpressed in  Escherichia coli using a pLex-based expression system. The recombinant CphAII  protein was purified by a combination of heating (to denature E. coli proteins)  and two steps of immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme  preparation did not exhibit a beta-lactamase activity but showed a  metal-dependent phosphodiesterase activity versus bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate and  thymidine 5'-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester, with an optimum at 85 degrees C.   The circular dichroism spectrum was in agreement with the percentage of secondary  structures characteristic of the MBL alphabetabetaalpha fold.
