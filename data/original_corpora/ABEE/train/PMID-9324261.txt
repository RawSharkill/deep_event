Role of the acrAB locus in organic solvent tolerance mediated by expression of  marA, soxS, or robA in Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli K-12 strains are normally tolerant to n-hexane and susceptible  to cyclohexane. Constitutive expression of marA of the multiple antibiotic  resistance (mar) locus or of the soxS or robA gene product produced tolerance to   cyclohexane. Inactivation of the mar locus or the robA locus, but not the soxRS  locus, increased organic solvent susceptibility in the wild type and Mar mutants   (to both n-hexane and cyclohexane). The organic solvent hypersusceptibility is a   newly described phenotype for a robA inactivated strain. Multicopy expression of   mar, soxS, or robA induced cyclohexane tolerance in strains with a deleted or  inactivated chromosomal mar, soxRS, or robA locus; thus, each transcriptional  activator acts independently of the others. However, in a strain with 39 kb of  chromosomal DNA, including the mar locus, deleted, only the multicopy complete  mar locus, consisting of its two operons, produced cyclohexane tolerance.  Deletion of acrAB from either wild-type E. coli K-12 or a Mar mutant resulted in   loss of tolerance to both n-hexane and cyclohexane. Organic solvent tolerance  mediated by mar, soxS, or robA was not restored in strains with acrAB deleted.  These findings strongly suggest that active efflux specified by the acrAB locus  is linked to intrinsic organic solvent tolerance and to tolerance mediated by the  marA, soxS, or robA gene product in E. coli.
