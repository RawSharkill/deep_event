Major facilitator superfamily. 

The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is one of the two largest families of  membrane transporters found on Earth. It is present ubiquitously in bacteria,  archaea, and eukarya and includes members that can function by solute uniport,  solute/cation symport, solute/cation antiport and/or solute/solute antiport with   inwardly and/or outwardly directed polarity. All homologous MFS protein sequences  in the public databases as of January 1997 were identified on the basis of  sequence similarity and shown to be homologous. Phylogenetic analyses revealed  the occurrence of 17 distinct families within the MFS, each of which generally  transports a single class of compounds. Compounds transported by MFS permeases  include simple sugars, oligosaccharides, inositols, drugs, amino acids,  nucleosides, organophosphate esters, Krebs cycle metabolites, and a large variety  of organic and inorganic anions and cations. Protein members of some MFS families  are found exclusively in bacteria or in eukaryotes, but others are found in  bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. All permeases of the MFS possess either 12 or   14 putative or established transmembrane alpha-helical spanners, and evidence is   presented substantiating the proposal that an internal tandem gene duplication  event gave rise to a primordial MFS protein prior to divergence of the family  members. All 17 families are shown to exhibit the common feature of a  well-conserved motif present between transmembrane spanners 2 and 3. The analyses  reported serve to characterize one of the largest and most diverse families of  transport proteins found in living organisms.
