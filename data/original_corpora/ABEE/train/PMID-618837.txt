Evolution of Pseudomonas R-plasmids: consequences of Tn1 insertion and resultant   partial diploidy to chromosome and Tra- R-plasmid mobilization.

Tn1 transposes from pRO161, a Tra- derivative of RP1, to Pseudomonas aeruginosa  sex factor FP2. The acquisition of Tn1 by FP2 results in its ability to mobilize   pRO161 to other bacteria. Genetic evidence presented here suggests two sequential  mechanisms. Initially, transposition of Tn1 results in trans-diploidy for the  Tra+ and Tra- plasmids. This subsequently allows mobilization of the Tra-  R-plasmid dependent on a host recombination mechanism. Transconjugants from this   mating contain either stable cointegrate R-plasmids or aggregates resulting from   dissociation of the cointegrates into a Tra+ and Tra- plasmid. These aggregates  have lost at least part of Tn1 from their parent FP2:Tn1 component, but now they   mobilize the tra- R-plasmid from a recombination-deficient (Rec-) genetic  background as well as from Rec+ donor strains. Transconjugants from these  retransfer matings are aggregates. These results suggest a contribution of  transposons to R-plasmid evolution and dissemination beyond the mere acquisition   of resistance to a given antibiotic.
