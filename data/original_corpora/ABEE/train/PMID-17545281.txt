Protein modulator of multidrug efflux gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

nalC multidrug-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa show enhanced  expression of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux system as a direct result of the  production of a ca. 6,100-Da protein, PA3719, in these mutants. Using a bacterial  two-hybrid system, PA3719 was shown to interact in vivo with MexR, a repressor of  mexAB-oprM expression. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies confirmed a  high-affinity interaction (equilibrium dissociation constant [K(D)], 158.0 +/-  18.1 nM) of PA3719 with MexR in vitro. PA3719 binding to and formation of a  complex with MexR obviated repressor binding to its operator, which overlaps the   efflux operon promoter, suggesting that mexAB-oprM hyperexpression in nalC  mutants results from PA3719 modulation of MexR repressor activity. Consistent  with this, MexR repression of mexA transcription in an in vitro transcription  assay was alleviated by PA3719. Mutations in MexR compromising its interaction  with PA3719 in vivo were isolated and shown to be located internally and  distributed throughout the protein, suggesting that they impacted PA3719 binding   by altering MexR structure or conformation rather than by having residues  interacting specifically with PA3719. Four of six mutant MexR proteins studied  retained repressor activity even in a nalC strain producing PA3719. Again, this  is consistent with a PA3719 interaction with MexR being necessary to obviate MexR  repressor activity. The gene encoding PA3719 has thus been renamed armR  (antirepressor for MexR). A representative "noninteracting" mutant MexR protein,   MexR(I104F), was purified, and ITC confirmed that it bound PA3719 with reduced  affinity (5.4-fold reduced; K(D), 853.2 +/- 151.1 nM). Consistent with this,  MexR(I104F) repressor activity, as assessed using the in vitro transcription  assay, was only weakly compromised by PA3719. Finally, two mutations (L36P and  W45A) in ArmR compromising its interaction with MexR have been isolated and  mapped to a putative C-terminal alpha-helix of the protein that alone is  sufficient for interaction with MexR.
