Characterization of the gene for the chromosomal dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)  of Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990: the origin of the  trimethoprim resistant S1 DHFR from Staphylococcus aureus? 

The gene for the chromosomally encoded dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of  Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 has been cloned and characterized. The  structural gene encodes a polypeptide of 161 amino acid residues with a  calculated molecular weight of 18,417. This trimethoprim-sensitive (Tmps) DHFR,  SeDHFR, differs in only three amino acids (Val-31-->Ile, Gly-43-->Ala, and  Phe-98-->Tyr) from the trimethoprim resistant (Tmpr) S1 DHFR encoded by  transposon Tn4003. Since in addition the S. epidermidis gene also forms part of  an operon with thyE and open reading frame 140 as in Tn4003, the chromosomally  located gene encoding the Tmps SeDHFR is likely to be the molecular origin of the  plasmid-located gene encoding the Tmpr S1 DHFR. Site-directed mutagenesis and  kinetic analysis of the purified enzymes suggest that a single Phe-->Tyr change  at position 98 is the major determinant of trimethoprim resistance.
