Selenium and immune responses.

Selenium (Se) affects all components of the immune system, i.e., the development   and expression of nonspecific, humoral, and cell-mediated responses. In general,   a deficiency in Se appears to result in immunosuppression, whereas  supplementation with low doses of Se appears to result in augmentation and/or  restoration of immunologic functions. A deficiency of Se has been shown to  inhibit resistance to microbial and viral infections, neutrophil function,  antibody production, proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in response to  mitogens, and cytodestruction by T lymphocytes and NK cells. Supplementation with  Se has been shown to stimulate the function of neutrophils, production of  antibodies, proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in response to mitogens,  production of lymphokines, NK cell-mediated cytodestruction, delayed-type  hypersensitivity reactions and allograft rejection, and the ability of a host to   reject transplanted malignant tumors. The mechanism(s) whereby Se affects the  immune system is speculative. The effects of Se on the function of glutathione  peroxidase and on the cellular levels of reduced glutathione and H2Se, as well as  the ability of Se to interact with cell membranes, probably represent only a few   of many regulatory mechanisms. The manipulation of cellular levels of Se may be  significant for the maintenance of general health and for the control of  immunodeficiency disorders and the chemoprevention of cancer.
