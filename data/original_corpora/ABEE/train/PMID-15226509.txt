Structure of the periplasmic component of a bacterial drug efflux pump. 

Multidrug resistance among Gram-negative bacteria is conferred by three-component  membrane pumps that expel diverse antibiotics from the cell. These efflux pumps  consist of an inner membrane transporter such as the AcrB proton antiporter, an  outer membrane exit duct of the TolC family, and a periplasmic protein known as  the adaptor. We present the x-ray structure of the MexA adaptor from the human  pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The elongated molecule contains three linearly  arranged subdomains; a 47-A-long alpha-helical hairpin, a lipoyl domain, and a  six-stranded beta-barrel. In the crystal, hairpins of neighboring MexA monomers  pack side-by-side to form twisted arcs. We discuss the implications of the  packing of molecules within the crystal. On the basis of the structure and  packing, we suggest a model for the key periplasmic interaction between the outer  membrane channel and the adaptor protein in the assembled drug efflux pump.
