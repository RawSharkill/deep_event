[Gene amplification in prokaryote and eukaryote systems].

The studied cases of gene amplification in bacteriophages, bacteria, yeasts,  Drosophila, animal viruses and animal cells are reviewed. It is suggested that  gene amplification is the mechanism universal for all classes of organisms and  necessary for: 1) rendering the needed overhigh level of gene expression provided  that the efficiency of the given gene transcription reaches in maximum (adaptive   amplification), 2) preferential genome replication in case the efficiency of  replication initiation reaches its maximum (competitive amplification), 3)  rendering the essential stable DNA-protein interaction, if this interaction is  damaged by DNA deletion (compensatory amplification). Molecular mechanisms for  gene amplifications are: a) multiple sequential gene duplications, b)  differential overreplication, excision, extrareplication and reintegration.
