Specific regulatory interconnection between the leucine and histidine pathways of  Neurospora crassa.

Leucine auxotrophs of Neurospora fall into two discrete categories with respect  to sensitivity to the herbicide, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The pattern of  resistance corresponds exactly to the ability to produce the leucine pathway  control elements, alpha-isopropylmalate and the leu-3 product. An analysis of the  regulatory response of the production of enzymes of histidine biosynthesis to  alpha-isopropylmalate implicates the control elements of the leucine pathway as  important components of the mechanism governing the production of the target  enzyme of aminotriazole inhibition, imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (EC  4.2.1.19). The evidence suggests that the regulatory interconnection between the   two pathways is direct and is independent of other general integrating regulatory  mechanisms which appear to be operative in both pathways. A general method for  isolating leu-1 and leu-2, as well as other regulatory mutants, is described,  which takes advantage of the specificity of the resistance to the inhibitor. Use   of analogous systems is prescribed for the analysis of other regulatory  interconnections which, like this one, might not be anticipated directly from  structural or biosynthetic considerations.
