Eliminatory action of glycine on drug resistance of Escherichia coli K12  harboring an R factor.

Glycine, known to inhibit the synthesis of a peptidoglycan component of the  bacterial cell wall, was effective in eliminating drug resistance of Escherichia   coli K12 JE2100 strain harboring theR100-1 factor although in lower frequencies  than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The action of glycine was found to be   less effective on the same R factor in JE177 strain, and not effective on the F  factor in W6. Infection of R factors from R+ cells to R- cells was found to take   place in the glycine broth as efficiently as in broth without glycine. This might  result in lowering the apparent efficiency of the action of glycine on those  plasmids. The segregation patterns of drug-susceptible clones obtained by the  glycine treatment were different from those obtained after the SDS treatment.  These results coupled with other evidences suggest that the mode of action of  glycine on R+ cells maybe different from those of other curing agents and may  involve mechanisms other than selection of R- or drug susceptible segregantsthat   are present in R+ culture.
