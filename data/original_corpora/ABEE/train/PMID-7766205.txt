Understanding cellular responses to toxic agents: a model for mechanism-choice in  bacterial metal resistance.

Bacterial resistances to metals are heterogeneous in both their genetic and  biochemical bases. Metal resistance may be chromosomally-, plasmid- or  transposon-encoded, and one or more genes may be involved: at the biochemical  level at least six different mechanisms are responsible for resistance. Various  types of resistance mechanisms can occur singly or in combination and for a  particular metal different mechanisms of resistance can occur in the same  species. To understand better the diverse responses of bacteria to metal ion  challenge we have constructed a qualitative model for the selection of metal  resistance in bacteria. How a bacterium becomes resistant to a particular metal  depends on the number and location of cellular components sensitive to the  specific metal ion. Other important selective factors include the nature of the  uptake systems for the metal, the role and interactions of the metal in the  normal metabolism of the cell and the availability of plasmid (or transposon)  encoded resistance mechanisms. The selection model presented is based on the  interaction of these factors and allows predictions to be made about the  evolution of metal resistance in bacterial populations. It also allows prediction  of the genetic basis and of mechanisms of resistance which are in substantial  agreement with those in well-documented populations. The interaction of, and  selection for resistance to, toxic substances in addition to metals, such as  antibiotics and toxic analogues, involve similar principles to those concerning  metals. Potentially, models for selection of resistance to any substance can be  derived using this approach.
