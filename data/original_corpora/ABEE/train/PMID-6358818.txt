Concurrent transfer and recombination between plasmids encoding for heat-stable  enterotoxin and drug resistance in porcine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

The frequency of and genetic mechanisms for simultaneous transfer of genes  encoding for tetracycline and sulpha-streptomycin resistance, heat-labile (LT)  and heat-stable (ST-mouse) enterotoxin production in porcine enterotoxigenic  Escherichia coli to Escherichia coli K12 were investigated. Seven E. coli strains  of 0-group 149 were studied by conjugation and transformation experiments. All  strains transferred tetracycline-resistance plasmids at a high frequency. No  interaction was observed between these plasmids and those encoding for LT  production. However, most tetracycline resistant recipient cells were ST-mouse+  following recombination events between plasmids encoding for colicin B and  ST-mouse production and plasmids encoding for tetracycline resistance.  Alternatively, when selecting for sulpha or streptomycin resistance a majority of  the transconjugants were also ST-mouse+, as plasmids coding for sulpha and  streptomycin were mobilized by the colicin B and ST-mouse encoding plasmid. Since  the simultaneous transfer of genes encoding for drug resistance, colicin B and  ST-mouse production are common events in vitro, they might also occur frequently   in vivo during antibiotic selective pressure.
