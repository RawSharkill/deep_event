Molecular characterization of MexL, the transcriptional repressor of the mexJK  multidrug efflux operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa mexJK efflux operon is constitutively expressed in  mutants with defects in the upstream mexL gene, which encodes a repressor of the   TetR family. MexL and a MexL(A47D) mutant protein were purified from Escherichia   coli as fusion proteins with carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tags. Native  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography revealed  that MexL is a tetramer in solution. MexL and MexL(A47D) oligomerization was  confirmed using a genetic approach, and the MexL(A47D) mutant protein was not  impaired in multimerization. Gel mobility shift and footprinting assays  demonstrated that MexL, but not MexL(A47D), binds specifically to the 94-bp  mexL-mexJ intergenic region to sequences located between positions -84 and -20  from the mexJ initiation codon. MexL protected about 60 nucleotides on each  strand, and the protected regions overlapped almost perfectly, a finding  consistent with MexL regulating the expression of both mexL and mexJK, which was   ascertained by gene fusion analyses. The protected region contains predicted -10   and -35 promoter sequences for both mexL and mexJ, with partially overlapping -10  regions. The mexL promoter assignment was verified by mapping the mexL  transcription start site, and the mexJ promoter was localized to the predicted  regions using lacZ fusions. The MexL-protected region contains two inverted  GTATTT repeats, and their location in the protected region and overlap with the  mexL and mexJ promoter sequences strongly support a role in MexL binding.
