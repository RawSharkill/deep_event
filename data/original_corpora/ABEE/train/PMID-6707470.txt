Mechanisms of resistance of staphylococci grown in plasma to polymorph  bactericidins.

The mechanisms whereby staphylococcal strains grown in plasma assume increased  resistance to polymorph bactericidins were investigated. Observations reported  here showed that cultural conditions could determine the path of conversion to  resistance. Staphylococcal strains and mutants lacking either free coagulase or  clumping factor or both all showed enhanced resistance after 10 h incubation in  plasma proteins, thus giving no clear indication that these factors were involved  in the interactions. In fact, prolonged incubation in bovine serum albumin (22 h)  and ordinary broth medium (24 h) also resulted in increased resistance. A  distinction between staphylococcal factors interacting specifically with plasma  proteins and such non-specific conversions was obtained in two different ways.  Stripping of a hypothetical surface protein by treatment with trypsin or 2 M  potassium bromide rendered plasma- but not 24 h-broth organisms susceptible,  indicating protein coating of plasma-grown organisms. Also free  coagulase-positive strains and mutants incubated in plasma for 30 min were  converted while those lacking both or possessing clumping factor alone were not.   It therefore appears that one of the mechanisms of acquiring resistance involves   a rapid interaction between staphylococcal-free coagulase and fibrinogen,  resulting in the deposition of fibrin or fibrin derivatives on the bacterial  surface.
