Substitutions in the eyelet region disrupt cefepime diffusion through the  Escherichia coli OmpF channel. 

The Escherichia coli OmpF porin is a nonspecific channel involved in the membrane  translocation of small hydrophilic molecules and especially in the passage of  beta-lactam antibiotics. In order to understand the dynamic of charged-compound  uptake through bacterial porins, specific charges located in the E. coli OmpF  channel were mutated. Substitutions G119D and G119E, inserting a protruding  acidic side chain into the pore, decreased cephalosporin and colicin  susceptibilities. Cefepime diffusion was drastically altered by these mutations.   Conversely, substitutions R132A and R132D, changing a residue located in the  positively charged cluster, increased the rate of cephalosporin uptake without  modifying colicin sensitivity. Modelling approaches suggest that G119E generates   a transverse hydrogen bond dividing the pore, while the two R132 substitutions  stretch the channel size. These charge alterations located in the constriction  area have differential effects on cephalosporin diffusion and substantially  modify the profile of antibiotic susceptibility.
