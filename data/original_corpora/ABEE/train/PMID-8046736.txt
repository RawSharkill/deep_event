Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of insertion mutations in the  transferrin-binding system of Haemophilus influenzae type b.

A mutagenesis system involving the insertion of a non-transposable antibiotic  resistance gene cassette was used to generate stable mutations in the chromosome   of Haemophilus influenzae type b strain Eagan. The mutations generated were shown  by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to have unique SmaI fingerprint  patterns and to be located randomly on the chromosome. Of 700 insertion mutants  screened, 29 had stable insertions resulting in constitutive expression of  transferrin-binding proteins (TBPs). The high proportion of such mutants  indicated that numerous regulatory loci could influence the expression of this  phenotype. Five such regulatory mutations were analysed in detail by PFGE and DNA  hybridisation and were shown to be located at five different chromosomal loci,  although three of the five loci were located on the same 330-kb SmaI fragment of   the wild-type strain Eagan chromosome. This fragment also contains several  important virulence determinants, including the capb locus, and one of the five  constitutive mutants had concomitantly lost the ability to synthesise a type-b  capsule. No DNA homology was demonstrated between H. influenzae chromosomal  fragments separated by PFGE and DNA probes for the TBPs from Neisseria  meningitidis, but the possibility of shared regulatory mechanisms controlling the  expression of TBPs in these two species remains to be investigated.
