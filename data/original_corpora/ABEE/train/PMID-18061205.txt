The three-dimensional structure of VIM-2, a Zn-beta-lactamase from Pseudomonas  aeruginosa in its reduced and oxidised form. 

The crystal structures of the universally widespread metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)  Verona integron-encoded MBL (VIM)-2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been solved   in their native form as well as in an unexpected oxidised form. This  carbapenem hydrolysing enzyme belongs to the so-called B1 subfamily of MBLs and  shares the folding of alpha beta/beta alpha sandwich, consisting of a core of  beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices. Surprisingly, it showed a high tendency  to be strongly oxidised at the catalytic cysteine located in the Cys site,  Cys221, which, in the oxidised structure, becomes a cysteinesulfonic residue. Its  native structure was obtained only in the presence of  Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. This oxidation might be a consequence of a lower  affinity for the second Zn located in the Cys site that would also explain the  observed susceptibility of VIM-2 to chelating agents. This modification, if  present in nature, might play a role in catalytic down-regulation. Comparison  between native and oxidised VIM-2 and a predicted model of VIM-1 (which shows one  residue different in the Cys site compared with VIM-2) is performed to explain  the different activities and antibiotic specificities.
