A novel hybrid SCCmec-mecC region in Staphylococcus sciuri. 

OBJECTIVES: Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus spp. results from the  expression of an alternative penicillin-binding protein 2a (encoded by mecA) with  a low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Recently, a novel variant of mecA  known as mecC (formerly mecALGA251) was identified in Staphylococcus aureus  isolates from both humans and animals. In this study, we identified two  Staphylococcus sciuri subsp. carnaticus isolates from bovine infections that  harbour three different mecA homologues: mecA, mecA1 and mecC. METHODS: We  subjected the two isolates to whole-genome sequencing to further understand the  genetic context of the mec-containing region. We also used PCR and RT-PCR to  investigate the excision and expression of the SCCmec element and mec genes,  respectively. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel hybrid SCCmec  region at the orfX locus consisting of a class E mec complex  (mecI-mecR1-mecC1-blaZ) located immediately downstream of a staphylococcal  cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type VII element. A second SCCmec attL site  (attL2), which was imperfect, was present downstream of the mecC region. PCR  analysis of stationary-phase cultures showed that both the SCCmec type VII  element and a hybrid SCCmec-mecC element were capable of excision from the genome  and forming a circular intermediate. Transcriptional analysis showed that mecC  and mecA, but not mecA1, were both expressed in liquid culture supplemented with   oxacillin. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study further highlights that a range of  staphylococcal species harbour the mecC gene and furthers the view that  coagulase-negative staphylococci associated with animals may act as reservoirs of  antibiotic resistance genes for more pathogenic staphylococcal species.
