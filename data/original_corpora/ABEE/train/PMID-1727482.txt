Construction of a transducing virus from double-stranded RNA bacteriophage phi6:   establishment of carrier states in host cells.

Bacteriophage phi 6 contains three double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomic segments.   We have constructed a plasmid that contains a cDNA copy of the middle (M)  segment, with a gene for kanamycin resistance (kan) inserted into the PstI site.   A transcript of this cDNA was incorporated in vitro into procapsids along with  natural transcripts of the S and L segments. The procapsids were coated with  nucleocapsid surface protein P8 and transfected into Pseudomonas syringae pv.  phaseolicola. The resulting infectious virus, phi 6 K1, was found to contain an M  segment that was 1.2 kbp larger than the normal 4.1 kbp. K1 formed small, turbid   plaques, and its genome was unstable. Preparations of K1 contained from about 0.1  to 10% large, clear-plaque forms of the virus which were usually missing the kan   gene, and in some cases, the resulting segment M was smaller than its normal  size. Cells picked from lawns of host cells infected with K1 yielded colonies  that were resistant to kanamycin (Kan). These colonies could be passaged on  kanamycin containing medium. The cells were found to contain large amounts of  dsRNA corresponding to the viral genomic segments. Some strains continued to  produce viable phage, while others lost this ability. One strain completely lost   the small genomic segment S. Approximately 1 in 10,000 infected cells acquired  the carrier state with the original phage isolate K1. However, we isolated a  viral mutant that was able to induce the carrier state in 10 to 20% of the  infected cells. The ability to use drug resistance as a test for the carrier  state makes this system very useful for the study of the mechanisms of induction   of persistent infections.
