On functional and structural heterogeneity of VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamases. 

The VIM metallo-beta-lactamases are emerging resistance determinants, encoded by   mobile genetic elements, that have recently been detected in multidrug-resistant   nosocomial isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative pathogens.   In this work a T7-based expression system for overproduction of the VIM-2 enzyme   by Escherichia coli was developed, which yielded approximately 80 mg of protein  per litre of culture. The enzyme was mostly released into the medium, from which   it was recovered at >99% purity by an initial ammonium sulphate precipitation  followed by two chromatography steps, with almost 80% efficiency. Determination  of kinetic parameters of VIM-2 under the same experimental conditions previously   used for VIM-1 (the first VIM-type enzyme detected in clinical isolates, which is  93% identical to VIM-2) revealed significant differences in K(m) values and/or  turnover rates with several substrates, including penicillins, cephalosporins and  carbapenems. Compared with VIM-1, VIM-2 is more susceptible to inactivation by  chelators, indicating that the zinc ions of the latter are probably more loosely   bound. These data indicated that at least some of the amino acid differences  between the two proteins have functional significance. Molecular modelling of the  two enzymes identified some amino acid substitutions, including those at  positions 223, 224 and 228 (in the BBL numbering), that could be relevant to the   changes in catalytic behaviour.
