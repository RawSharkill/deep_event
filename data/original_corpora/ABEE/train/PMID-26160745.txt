Multidrug-Resistance Transporter AbcA Secretes Staphylococcus aureus Cytolytic  Toxins. 

Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are Staphylococcus aureus cytolytic toxins that  lyse erythrocytes and neutrophils and have important functions in the S. aureus  infectious process. The molecular mechanisms of PSM secretion, however, are not  well understood. Here we report that knockout of the multidrug-resistance ABC  transporter AbcA, which contributes to S. aureus resistance against antibiotics  and chemicals, diminished the secreted amount of PSM, leading to the accumulation  of PSM in the intracellular fraction. The amount of PSM in the culture  supernatants of the abcA knockout mutants was restored by introduction of the  wild-type abcA gene, whereas it was not completely restored by introduction of  mutant abcA genes encoding AbcA mutant proteins carrying amino acid substitutions  in the adenosine triphosphate binding motifs. The abcA knockout mutant exhibited   attenuated virulence in a mouse systemic infection model. These findings suggest   that the multidrug resistance transporter AbcA secretes PSMs and contributes to  S. aureus virulence.
