Use of live Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells as a biological response modifier in  experimental infections.

A short-term oral administration of live Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, strain  Sillix Hansen DSM 1883, resulted in enhanced resistance of mice toward infections  with K. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes A produced by intranasal  inoculation. Yeast pre-treatment also increased the efficacy of antibiotic  therapy in bacterial infections and of antiviral drugs in viral infections. Yeast  treatment of animals stimulated phagocytosis, activated the complement system and  induced interferon which are likely to represent the main mechanisms of action  whereby pretreatment of mice with live S. cerevisiae cells increases resistance  to infection. It is concluded that preventive administration of live  Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells should be used for increasing resistance to  bacterial infections, in particular of the respiratory tract, or to viral  infections, as well as an adjunct to antibiotic and antiviral drug therapy.
