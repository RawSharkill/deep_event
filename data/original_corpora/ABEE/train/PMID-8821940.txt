The local repressor AcrR plays a modulating role in the regulation of acrAB genes  of Escherichia coli by global stress signals.

Genes acrAB encode a multidrug efflux pump in Escherichia coli. We have  previously reported that transcription of acrAB is increased under general stress  conditions (i.e. 4% ethanol, 0.5 M NaCl, and the stationary phase in  Luria-Bertani medium). In this study, lacZ transcriptional fusions and an in  vitro gel mobility shift assay have been utilized to study the mechanisms  governing the regulation of acrAB. We found that a closely linked gene, acrR,  encoded a repressor of acrAB. Nevertheless, the general stress conditions  increased transcription of acrAB in the absence of functional AcrR, and such  conditions surprisingly increased the transcription of acrR even more strongly  than that of acrAB. These results suggest that the general-stress-induced  transcription of acrAB is primarily mediated by global regulatory pathway(s), and  that one major role of AcrR is to function as a specific secondary modulator to  fine tune the level of acrAB transcription and to prevent the unwanted  overexpression of acrAB. To our knowledge, this represents a novel mechanism of  regulating gene expression in E. coli. Evidence also suggests that the  up-regulation of acrAB expression under general stress conditions is not likely  to be mediated by the known global regulators, such as MarA or SoxS, although  elevated levels of these proteins were shown to increase the transcription of  acrAB.
