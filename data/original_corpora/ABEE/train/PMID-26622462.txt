Differences in 23S ribosomal RNA mutations between wild-type and mutant  macrolide resistant Chlamydia trachomatis isolates. 

The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of  wild-type and mutant clinical isolates of Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis strains to  erythromycin, azithromycin and josamycin, and to identify the  resistance-conferring 23S ribosomal (r)RNA mutations in the isolates. The  wild-type resistant isolates were defined as those with minimum inhibitory  concentration values above the tissue concentration of the antibiotic in the  urogenital system. Furthermore, all resistant C. trachomatis isolates were  exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides, and 13 resistant mutants   were selected following serial passages. Among the 8 wild-type isolates that were  resistant to erythromycin, 3 isolates had a mutation at T2611C in the 23S rRNA  gene while the others did not show any 23S rRNA mutations. The selected mutant  isolates showed a 4- to 16-fold reduction in in vitro sensitivities. With regard   to the mutant strains, the T2611C mutation was found in 10 isolates, A2057G  mutation in 6 isolates, and A2059G mutation in 1 isolate. Thus, the  macrolide resistant isolates of the wild-type strain had different mutations from  those selected by exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides. Also,   since 23S rRNA mutations were not identified in certain isolates, it was  considered that other molecular mechanisms may also be responsible for the  macrolide resistance of C. trachomatis.
