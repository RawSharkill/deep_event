Complete genome sequence of the dehalorespiring bacterium Desulfitobacterium  hafniense Y51 and comparison with Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195. 

Desulfitobacterium strains have the ability to dechlorinate halogenated compounds  under anaerobic conditions by dehalorespiration. The complete genome of the  tetrachloroethene (PCE)-dechlorinating strain Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y51 is  a 5,727,534-bp circular chromosome harboring 5,060 predicted protein coding  sequences. This genome contains only two reductive dehalogenase genes, a lower  number than reported in most other dehalorespiring strains. More than 50 members   of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase superfamily and 30 paralogs of the  flavoprotein subunit of the fumarate reductase are encoded as well. A remarkable   feature of the genome is the large number of O-demethylase paralogs, which allow   utilization of lignin-derived phenyl methyl ethers as electron donors. The large   genome reveals a more versatile microorganism that can utilize a larger set of  specialized electron donors and acceptors than previously thought. This is in  sharp contrast to the PCE-dechlorinating strain Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195,   which has a relatively small genome with a narrow metabolic repertoire. A genomic  comparison of these two very different strains allowed us to narrow down the  potential candidates implicated in the dechlorination process. Our results  provide further impetus to the use of desulfitobacteria as tools for  bioremediation.
