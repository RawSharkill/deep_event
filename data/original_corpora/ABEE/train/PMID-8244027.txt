Characterization of a Streptomyces antibioticus gene cluster encoding a  glycosyltransferase involved in oleandomycin inactivation. 

By homology to the mgt gene (encoding a macrolide glycosyltransferase) from  Streptomyces lividans, a 3.3-kb DNA fragment from the oleandomycin producer,  Streptomyces antibioticus, was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence  revealed the presence of the 3' end of a gene (ORF1) and two complete ORFs (ORF2   and oleD), all of them translationally coupled. The deduced product of the  sequenced region of ORF1 contained the typical signature of integral membrane  proteins responsible for the translocation of substrates across the membrane. The  ORF2 product did not show significant similarity with proteins in databases, but   contains an N-terminus leader peptide region characteristic of secreted proteins,  and a lipid attachment site motif characteristic of membrane lipoproteins  synthesized with a precursor signal peptide. The oleD product showed clear  similarity with several UDP-glucuronosyl- and UDP-glycosyl-transferases from  different origins and particularly with the mgt gene from S. lividans, and might   encode a glycosyltransferase activity capable of inactivating macrolides. It is  proposed that these three genes could participate in the intracellular  glycosylation of oleandomycin and its secretion during antibiotic production.
