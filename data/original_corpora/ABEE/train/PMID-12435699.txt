Emergence of tetracycline resistance in Helicobacter pylori: multiple mutational   changes in 16S ribosomal DNA and other genetic loci. 

Tetracycline is useful in combination therapies against the gastric pathogen  Helicobacter pylori. We found 6 tetracycline resistant (Tet(r)) strains among 159  clinical isolates (from El Salvador, Lithuania, and India) and obtained the  following four results: (i) 5 of 6 Tet(r) isolates contained one or two  nucleotide substitutions in one part of the primary tetracycline binding site in   16S rRNA (AGA(965-967) [Escherichia coli coordinates] changed to gGA, AGc, guA,  or gGc [lowercase letters are used to represent the base changes]), whereas the  sixth (isolate Ind75) retained AGA(965-967); (ii) PCR products containing mutant   16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) alleles transformed recipient strains to Tet(r)  phenotypes, but transformants containing alleles with single substitutions (gGA  and AGc) were less resistant than their Tet(r) parents; (iii) each of 10 Tet(r)  mutants of reference strain 26695 (in which mutations were induced with  metronidazole, a mutagenic anti-H. pylori agent) contained the normal  AGA(965-967) sequence; and (iv) transformant derivatives of Ind75 and of one of  the Tet(r) 26695 mutants that had acquired mutant rDNA alleles were resistant to   tetracycline at levels higher than those to which either parent strain was  resistant. Thus, tetracycline resistance in H. pylori results from an  accumulation of changes that may affect tetracycline ribosome affinity and/or  other functions (perhaps porins or efflux pumps). We suggest that the rarity of  tetracycline resistance among clinical isolates reflects this need for multiple  mutations and perhaps also the deleterious effects of such mutations on fitness.   Formally equivalent mutations with small but additive effects are postulated to  contribute importantly to traits such as host specificity and virulence and to H.  pylori's great genetic diversity.
