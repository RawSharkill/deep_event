[Membrane mechanisms of excretion of physiologically active substances by  bacteria (review)].

The review covers the evidence on the mechanisms of regulation of intracellular  concentrations of low-molecular weight physiologically active substances, as well  as of other intermediate or end metabolites by means of their excretion from  bacterial cells. These processes can be considered as a particular level of  metabolic regulation that can be called "membrane regulation".
