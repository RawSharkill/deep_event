Selection and transformation of non-beta-lactamase-mediated insusceptibility to  beta-lactams in Haemophilus influenzae: lack of cross-resistance between  carbapenems and other agents.

Non-beta-lactamase-mediated insusceptibility to beta-lactams was studied in  Haemophilus influenzae. Mutants resistant to ampicillin were selected in a  susceptible isolate, while phenotypically similar resistance was transformed from  four wild-type isolates into a susceptible recipient. Ampicillin selected mutants  generally had reduced susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins and  aztreonam. Reduced susceptibility to meropenem was less common, and  susceptibility to imipenem was unaffected. MICs of three cephalosporins and  aztreonam were much higher for the ampicillin resistant transformants than for  the recipient strain, and were generally equal to, or within one doubling  dilution of, the concentrations that inhibited the donor parents. In contrast,  reduced susceptibility to imipenem observed with one parent (MIC of 4 mg/l) was  not transferred to the recipient (MIC of 0.5 mg/l). Meropenem inhibited 22 of 24   transformants tested at less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l, compared with MICs of  greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/l for the donor parents and 0.03 mg/l for the  recipient. These results indicated that the mechanisms that confer  non-beta-lactamase-mediated insusceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins and  aztreonam in H. influenzae have little or no effect on susceptibility to  carbapenems.
