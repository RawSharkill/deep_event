Pseudomonas cepacia: biology, mechanisms of virulence, epidemiology.

Pseudomonas cepacia, originally described as a plant pathogen, has emerged as an   important cause of infection in altered hosts, particularly in the hospital  setting. This organism's ability to survive and proliferate in a variety of  solutions, medications, and even disinfectants and antiseptics has resulted in  numerous clusters of common-source nosocomial infections. Many patients exposed  to P. cepacia are merely colonized, but serious infections, including surgical  and burn wound infections, bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, peritonitis, and  urinary tract infections, are not rare. The virulence properties of this pathogen  remain poorly characterized. Recently, P. cepacia has been reported in some  cystic fibrosis centers as an increasingly frequent pulmonary pathogen. This  trend has caused considerable concern because of reports of occasional cases of  fulminant necrotizing pneumonia and bacteremia. Conversely, many patients with CF  who become colonized with this organism have no ill effects. The epidemiology of   P. cepacia in the CF population is unclear, but some patients probably acquire  the organism from colonized siblings with CF. Circumstantial evidence suggests  that the organism may also be acquired in the hospital. Treatment of infections  is exceedingly difficult, particularly in patients with CF, because P. cepacia is  resistant to a broad range of antibiotics.
