Energy-dependent efflux mediated by class L (tetL) tetracycline resistance  determinant from streptococci. 

The class L (TetL) tetracycline resistance determinant from streptococci  specified resistance and an energy-dependent decreased accumulation of  tetracycline in both Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Using E. coli,   we showed that the reduced uptake resulted from active efflux. The streptococcal   class M determinant, known to render the protein synthesis machinery of S.  faecalis resistant to tetracycline inhibition, did not alter tetracycline  transport in either host.
