Acinetobacter spp., saprophytic organisms of increasing pathogenic importance.

Acinetobacter spp. are Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria commonly present  in soil and water as free-living saprophytes; they are isolated as commensals  from skin, throat and various secretions of healthy people. There have been  frequent changes in their taxonomy so that their pathogenic role in humans has  been understood only recently: Acinetobacter has emerged as an important  nosocomial pathogen involved in outbreaks of hospital infections. This ubiquitous  organism can be recovered from the hospital environment, from colonized or  infected patients or from staff (hand carriage). Acinetobacter as an  opportunistic pathogen is involved in nosocomial urinary tract infections,  bacteremia, wound and burn infections. Its predominant role is observed in  nosocomial pneumonia, particularly in fan-associated pneumonia. Acinetobacters  are responsible for difficult-to-treat infections due to their frequent multiple   resistance to major antibiotics available for the treatment of nosocomial  infections. Various mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides   have been recognized in these bacteria. Combination therapy is usually  recommended for the treatment of nosocomial infections. The increasing pathogenic  importance of Acinetobacter spp. and the increasing frequency of hospital  outbreaks of acinetobacter infections has made the development of reliable typing  methods imperative. Beside conventional "phenotypic" methods (serology, phage  typing), genotypic systems (ribotyping, plasmid profiles, pulse-field gel  electrophoresis) are currently advancing.
