Fitness Costs of Drug Resistance Mutations in Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium  tuberculosis: A Household-Based Case-Control Study. 

BACKGROUND: The projected long-term prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR)  tuberculosis depends upon the relative fitness of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis   strains, compared with non-MDR strains. While many experimental models have  tested the in vitro or in vivo fitness costs of various drug resistance  mutations, fewer epidemiologic studies have attempted to validate these  experimental findings. METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing drug   resistance-associated mutations from MDR M. tuberculosis strains causing multiple  cases in a household to matched MDR strains without evidence of secondary  household cases. RESULTS: Eighty-eight multiple-case and 88 single-case household  MDR strains were analyzed for 10 specific drug resistance-associated  polymorphisms previously associated with fitness effects. We found that the  isoniazid resistant katG Ser315Thr mutation occurred more than twice as  frequently in multiple-case households than in single-case households (odds ratio  [OR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.70), corroborating previous  experimental findings. However, strains carrying both the katG Ser315Thr mutation  and the rpsL Lys43Arg mutation were less likely to be found in multiple-case  households (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, .01-.73), suggesting a negative epistatic  interaction which contrasts previous findings. CONCLUSIONS: The case-control  design presents a useful approach for assessing in vivo fitness effects of drug  resistance mutations.
