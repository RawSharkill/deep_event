Towards an understanding of the genetics of bacterial metal resistance.

Many bacteria show great promise for use in metal recovery. However, the genetics  of metal-leaching, accumulation-resistance, and oxidation/reduction mechanisms of  these bacteria is still an area of research in its infancy. The introduction of  such genes into bacteria of economic importance would have application in  biomining and environmental bioremediation.
