Anti-parallel membrane topology of a homo-dimeric multidrug transporter, EmrE. 

EmrE in Escherichia coli belongs to the small multidrug resistance (SMR)  transporter family. It functions as a homo-dimer, but the orientation of the two   monomers in the membrane (membrane topology) is under debate. We expressed  various single-cysteine EmrE mutants in E. coli cells lacking a major efflux  transporter. Efflux from cells expressing the P55C or T56C mutant was blocked by   the external application of membrane-impermeable SH-reagents. This is difficult  to explain by the parallel topology configuration, because Pro55 and Thr56 are  considered to be located in the cytoplasm. From both the periplasm and the  cytoplasm, biotin-PE-maleimide, a bulky membrane-impermeable SH-reagent, could  access the cysteine residue at the 25th position in the presence of transport  substrates and at the 108th position. These observations support the  anti-parallel topology in the membrane.
