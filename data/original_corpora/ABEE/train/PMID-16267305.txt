Cell division defects in Escherichia coli deficient in the multidrug efflux  transporter AcrEF-TolC. 

The Escherichia coli chromosome contains several operons encoding confirmed and  predicted multidrug transporters. Among these transporters only the inactivation   of components of the AcrAB-TolC complex leads to substantial changes in  susceptibility to multiple drugs. This observation prompted a conclusion that  other transporters are silent or expressed at levels insufficient to contribute  to multidrug resistance phenotype. We found that increased expression of AcrA,  the periplasmic membrane fusion protein, is toxic only in cells lacking the  multidrug efflux transporter AcrEF. AcrEF-deficient cells with increased  expression of AcrA have a severe cell division defect that results in cell  filamentation (>50 microm). Similar defects were obtained in cells lacking the  outer membrane channel TolC, which acts with AcrEF, suggesting that cell  filamentation is caused by the loss of AcrEF function. Green fluorescent  protein-AcrA fusion studies showed that in normal and filamentous cells AcrA is  associated with membranes in a confined manner and that this localization is not   affected by the lack of AcrEF. Similarly, the structure and composition of  membranes were normal in filamentous cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that  the filamentous AcrEF-deficient E. coli cells are defective in chromosome  condensation and segregation. Our results suggest that the E. coli AcrEF  transporter is expressed under standard laboratory conditions and plays an  important role in the normal maintenance of cell division.
