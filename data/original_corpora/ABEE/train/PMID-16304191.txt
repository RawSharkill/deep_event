VIM-12, a novel plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamase from Klebsiella  pneumoniae that resembles a VIM-1/VIM-2 hybrid. 

A transferable plasmid from Klebsiella pneumoniae carried a class 1 integron  containing bla(VIM-12), a novel bla(VIM)-type gene, flanked by two copies of  aacA7. bla(VIM-12) was clustered between bla(VIM-1) and bla(VIM-2) and differed  from bla(VIM-1) by 18 nucleotides that were all located at the 3' end and matched  the corresponding nucleotides in bla(VIM-2). The bla(VIM-12)-associated 59-base  element was identical to that described in bla(VIM-2) alleles.
