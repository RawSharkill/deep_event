YybT is a signaling protein that contains a cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase  domain and a GGDEF domain with ATPase activity. 

The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-AMP [corrected] synthesized by the diadenylate  cyclase domain was discovered recently [corrected] as a messenger molecule for  signaling DNA breaks in Bacillus subtilis. By searching bacterial genomes, we  identified a family of DHH/DHHA1 domain proteins (COG3387) that co-occur with a  subset of the diadenylate cyclase domain proteins. Here we report that the B.  subtilis protein YybT, a member of the COG3387 family proteins, exhibits  phosphodiesterase activity toward cyclic dinucleotides. The DHH/DHHA1 domain  hydrolyzes c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP to generate the linear dinucleotides 5'-pApA and  5'-pGpG. The data suggest that c-di-AMP could be the physiological substrate for   YybT given the physiologically relevant Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) and the   presence of YybT family proteins in the bacteria lacking c-di-GMP signaling  network. The bacterial regulator ppGpp was found to be a strong competitive  inhibitor of the DHH/DHHA1 domain, suggesting that YybT is under tight control  during stringent response. In addition, the atypical GGDEF domain of YybT  exhibits unexpected ATPase activity, distinct from the common diguanylate cyclase  activity for GGDEF domains. We further demonstrate the participation of YybT in  DNA damage and acid resistance by characterizing the phenotypes of the DeltayybT   mutant. The novel enzymatic activity and stress resistance together point toward   a role for YybT in stress signaling and response.
