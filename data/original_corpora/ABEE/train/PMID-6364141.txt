Primary structure and transcription of an amplified genetic locus: the CUP1 locus  of yeast.

Copper resistance in yeast is controlled by the CUP1 locus. The level of  resistance is proportional to the copy number of this locus, which can be found  in up to 15 tandemly iterated copies. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms  controlling the amplification and expression of the CUP1, locus, we determined  its full nucleotide sequence. We have also identified and mapped two  transcription units within the basic amplification unit of CUP1 in laboratory  yeast strains. One of those transcription units is inducible by copper and  encodes a low molecular weight copper binding protein--copper chelatin. The  increased production of chelatin, due to both gene amplification and induction of  transcription, leads to increased resistance of yeast cells to copper ions.
