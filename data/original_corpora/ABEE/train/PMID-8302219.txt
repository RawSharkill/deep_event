ABC transporters: bacterial exporters. 

The ABC transporters (also called traffic ATPases) make up a large superfamily of  proteins which share a common function and a common ATP-binding domain. ABC  transporters are classified into three major groups: bacterial importers (the  periplasmic permeases), eukaryotic transporters, and bacterial exporters. We  present a comprehensive review of the bacterial ABC exporter group, which  currently includes over 40 systems. The bacterial ABC exporter systems are  functionally subdivided on the basis of the type of substrate that each  translocates. We describe three main groups: protein exporters, peptide  exporters, and systems that transport nonprotein substrates. Prototype exporters   from each group are described in detail to illustrate our current understanding  of this protein family. The prototype systems include the alpha-hemolysin,  colicin V, and capsular polysaccharide exporters from Escherichia coli, the  protease exporter from Erwinia chrysanthemi, and the glucan exporters from  Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium meliloti. Phylogenetic analysis of the  ATP-binding domains from 29 bacterial ABC exporters indicates that the bacterial   ABC exporters can be divided into two primary branches. One branch contains the  transport systems where the ATP-binding domain and the membrane-spanning domain  are present on the same polypeptide, and the other branch contains the systems  where these domains are found on separate polypeptides. Differences in substrate   specificity do not correlate with evolutionary relatedness. A complete survey of   the known and putative bacterial ABC exporters is included at the end of the  review.
