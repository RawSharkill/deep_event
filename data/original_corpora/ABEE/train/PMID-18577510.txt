AcrAB multidrug efflux pump regulation in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium  by RamA in response to environmental signals.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has at least nine multidrug efflux pumps.  Among these pumps, AcrAB is effective in generating drug resistance and has wide   substrate specificity. Here we report that indole, bile, and an Escherichia coli   conditioned medium induced the AcrAB pump in Salmonella through a specific  regulator, RamA. The RamA-binding sites were located in the upstream regions of  acrAB and tolC. RamA was required for indole induction of acrAB. Other regulators  of acrAB such as MarA, SoxS, Rob, SdiA, and AcrR did not contribute to acrAB  induction by indole in Salmonella. Indole activated ramA transcription, and  overproduction of RamA caused increased acrAB expression. In contrast, induction   of ramA was not required for induction of acrAB by bile. Cholic acid binds to  RamA, and we suggest that bile acts by altering pre-existing RamA. This points to  two different AcrAB regulatory modes through RamA. Our results suggest that RamA   controls the Salmonella AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux system through dual  regulatory modes in response to environmental signals.
