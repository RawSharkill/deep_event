Urinary tract infections in a South American population: dynamic spread of class   1 integrons and multidrug resistance by homologous and site-specific  recombination. 

One hundred four bacterial strains mediating urinary tract infections in separate  individuals from a Uruguayan community were isolated. Forty-six strains conferred  a multidrug resistance phenotype. All 104 strains were examined for the presence   of class 1, 2, and 3 integrons. Class 1 integrons were found in 21 isolates  across four distinct bacterial genera. A large class 1 integron in a Klebsiella  pneumoniae strain was fully sequenced and was 29,093 bp in length. This integron   probably arose by homologous recombination since it was embedded in a hybrid  Tn21-like transposon backbone which comprised a Tn5036-like tnp transposition  module at the IRi integron end and a Tn21 mer module at the IRt integron end. The  parent integron/transposon that contributed the Tn5036 module was not related to   Tn1696 since the integron insertion points in the transposon backbones were 16  bases apart. Examination of the other 20 class 1 integron-containing strains  revealed further evidence of genetic exchange. This included a strain that  possessed a Tn5036 module at the IRt end but not at the IRi end and another that   possessed a tnp module beyond IRi that was a hybrid of Tn21 and Tn5051 and that  is presumed to have arisen by site-specific recombination. This study highlights   the ability of different genetic elements to act cooperatively to spread and  rearrange antibiotic resistance in a community.
