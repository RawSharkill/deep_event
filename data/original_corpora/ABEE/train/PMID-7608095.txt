Transcriptional control of the mtr efflux system of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

The capacity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to resist structurally diverse hydrophobic   agents (HAs) because of the mtr (multiple transferable resistance) efflux system   was found to be regulated at the level of transcription by two distinct  mechanisms. This was surmised because a deletion that removed > 90% of the coding  sequence of the mtrR (multiple transferrable resistance regulator) gene or a  single-base-pair deletion within a 13-bp inverted repeat sequence located in its   promoter resulted in altered expression of the mtrC gene; mtrC encodes a 44-kDa  membrane lipoprotein essential for the efflux of HAs. However, the  single-base-pair deletion had the more significant impact on gene expression  since it resulted in the loss of expression of mtrR and a threefold increase in  the expression of mtrC. Hence, the mtr efflux system in gonococci is subject to  both MtrR-dependent and MtrR-independent regulation, and the levels of mtrC mRNA   correlate well with HA resistance levels in gonococci.
