Regulatory network of lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis in Yersinia  enterocolitica includes cell envelope-dependent signals. 

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a glycolipid present in the outer membrane of all  Gram-negative bacteria, and it is one of the signature molecules recognized by  the receptors of the innate immune system. In addition to its lipid A portion  (the endotoxin), its O-chain polysaccharide (the O-antigen) plays a critical role  in the bacterium-host interplay and, in a number of bacterial pathogens, it is a   virulence factor. We present evidence that, in Yersinia enterocolitica serotype  O:8, a complex signalling network regulates O-antigen expression in response to  temperature. Northern blotting and reporter fusion analyses indicated that  temperature regulates the O-antigen expression at the transcriptional level.  Promoter cloning showed that the O-antigen gene cluster contains two  transcriptional units under the control of promoters P(wb1) and P(wb2). The  activity of both promoters is under temperature regulation and is repressed in  bacteria grown at 37 degrees C. We demonstrate that the RosA/RosB efflux  pump/potassium antiporter system and Wzz, the O-antigen chain length determinant,  are indirectly involved in the regulation mainly affecting the activity of  promoter P(wb2). The rosAB transcription, under the control of P(ros), is  activated at 37 degrees C, and P(wb2) is repressed through the signals generated   by the RosAB system activation, i.e. decreased [K+] and increased [H+]. The wzz  transcription is under the control of P(wb2), and we show that, at 37 degrees C,   overexpression of Wzz downregulates slightly the P(wb1) and P(wb2) activities and  more strongly the P(ros) activity, with the net result that more O-antigen is  produced. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of Wzz causes membrane  stress that activates the CpxAR two-component signal transduction system.
