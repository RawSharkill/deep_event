Rot and SaeRS cooperate to activate expression of the staphylococcal  superantigen-like exoproteins. 

Staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen that is capable of  infecting a wide range of host tissues. This bacterium is able to evade the host   immune response by utilizing a repertoire of virulence factors. These factors are  tightly regulated by various two-component systems (TCS) and transcription  factors. Previous studies have suggested that transcriptional regulation of a  subset of immunomodulators, known as the staphylococcal superantigen-like  proteins (Ssls), is mediated by the master regulators accessory gene regulator  (Agr) TCS, S. aureus exoprotein expression (Sae) TCS, and Rot. Here we  demonstrate that Rot and SaeR, the response regulator of the Sae TCS, synergize  to coordinate the activation of the ssl promoters. We have determined that both  transcription factors are required, but that neither is sufficient, for promoter   activation. This regulatory scheme is mediated by direct binding of both  transcription factors to the ssl promoters. We also demonstrate that clinically  relevant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains respond to neutrophils  via the Sae TCS to upregulate the expression of ssls. Until now, Rot and the Sae   TCS have been proposed to work in opposition of one another on their target  genes. This is the first example of these two regulators working in concert to  activate promoters.
