[Mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria responsible for respiratory  infections].

Bacterial resistance is both a frequent phenomena and in perpetual evolution;  currently it effects all antibiotics. The acquisition of resistance is a result  of chromosomal mutations or is a contribution of genetic material either as  plasmids or transposons. The principle mechanisms which can be isolated or  associated can be grouped together under changes of bacterial permeability which   alters the target of the anti-infectious agents; or the synthesis of enzymes  which inhibit the activity of the antibiotic. Some micro-organisms such as  Staphylococcal aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain enterobacteria have developed resistance to  varying degrees against the antibiotics initially or more recently introduced  which pose, in some cases, very real therapeutic problems. The prescribing doctor  should recognise the principle bacterial phenotypes which are resistant, as well   as the rules of association of the different antibiotics in order to institute an  effective anti-infectious regime, which allows the cure of the patient and limits  any introduction of resistance or the selection of resistant mutants.
