Alterations in bacterial defense mechanisms of the lung induced by inhalation of   cadmium.

Exposure to an aerosol of CdCl2 has a marked proclivity to reduce the ability of   the lung to defined itself against microbial insults. A significant enhancement  of mortality was observed in mice exposed to CdCl2 concentrations ranging from 80  to 1600 mug/m3 prior to being challenged with viable streptococci. The increase  in percent mortality above control varied from 15% at the lowest CdCl2  concentration to approximately 70% at the highest concentration. In order to  determine the various mechanistic factors which may explain the observed effect  of reduced host resistance to infection, a variety of pulmonary defense systems  was studied. There was a significant decrease in the total number of alveolar  macrophages recoverable from rat lungs immediately after completion of the  exposure regimen. The number of macrophages returned to normal (about 5.5  million) within 24 hours after cessation of the exposure. However, total  polymorphonuclear leucocytes increased 1.5 million immediately after completion  of the exposure and 13 million within 24 hours after cessation of the exposure.  Lymphocyte numbers were not affected by these exposure levels. Data concerning  clearance of streptococci from the lung following CdCl2 exposure closely  correlated with the observed mortality pattern.
