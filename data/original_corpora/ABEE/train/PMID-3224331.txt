Evidence of multifactorial mechanisms in an adriamycin resistant HL-60  promyelocytic leukemia cell line.

HL-60/AR leukemia cells, which were 60-fold resistant to the growth inhibitory  activity of adriamycin, remained sensitive to the antiproliferative and  differentiation-inducing activities of aclacinomycin A. The replication of  HL-60/AR and of adriamycin sensitive parental HL-60 cells was inhibited by  greater than 80% by 30 nM aclacinomycin A and the majority of cells (about 60 to   70%) of each line underwent granulocytic differentiation when treated with this  agent, as assessed by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Measurement of the   initial rates of uptake of daunorubicin and steady-state levels of adriamycin in   sensitive and resistant lines indicated that transport differences do not fully  account for the insensitivity of HL-60/AR cells to these anthracyclines.  Furthermore, 30-fold greater levels of cell-associated adriamycin were required  in HL-60/AR cells for toxic effects equivalent to those occurring in parental  HL-60 cells. Analysis of DNA histograms of adriamycin treated HL-60 cells  indicated that cell-cycle progression was blocked in G2-M, while this antibiotic   blocked progression of resistant HL-60/AR cells in the S phase. These results  suggest that, in addition to alterations in membrane permeability, differential  sensitivity of multiple biochemical targets may be important in the toxicity and   the development of resistance to anthracyclines. Furthermore, the finding that  HL-60/AR cells do not exhibit cross-resistance to aclacinomycin A indicates that   this oligosaccharide-containing anthracycline may have utility in the treatment  of adriamycin resistant neoplasms.
