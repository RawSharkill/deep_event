DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones. 

For many years, DNA gyrase was thought to be responsible both for unlinking  replicated daughter chromosomes and for controlling negative superhelical tension  in bacterial DNA. However, in 1990 a homolog of gyrase, topoisomerase IV, that  had a potent decatenating activity was discovered. It is now clear that  topoisomerase IV, rather than gyrase, is responsible for decatenation of  interlinked chromosomes. Moreover, topoisomerase IV is a target of the  4-quinolones, antibacterial agents that had previously been thought to target  only gyrase. The key event in quinolone action is reversible trapping of  gyrase-DNA and topoisomerase IV-DNA complexes. Complex formation with gyrase is  followed by a rapid, reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis, cessation of growth,  and induction of the SOS response. At higher drug concentrations, cell death  occurs as double-strand DNA breaks are released from trapped gyrase and/or  topoisomerase IV complexes. Repair of quinolone induced DNA damage occurs largely  via recombination pathways. In many gram-negative bacteria, resistance to  moderate levels of quinolone arises from mutation of the gyrase A protein and  resistance to high levels of quinolone arises from mutation of a second gyrase  and/or topoisomerase IV site. For some gram-positive bacteria, the situation is  reversed: primary resistance occurs through changes in topoisomerase IV while  gyrase changes give additional resistance. Gyrase is also trapped on DNA by  lethal gene products of certain large, low-copy-number plasmids. Thus,  quinolone topoisomerase biology is providing a model for understanding aspects of  host-parasite interactions and providing ways to investigate manipulation of the   bacterial chromosome by topoisomerases.
