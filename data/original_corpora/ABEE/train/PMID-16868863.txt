The biosynthetic gene clusters of aminocoumarin antibiotics. 

Plants and microorganisms are the most important sources of secondary metabolites  in nature. For research in the functional genomics of secondary metabolism, and  for the biotechnological application of such research by genetic engineering and   combinatorial biosynthesis, most microorganisms offer a unique advantage to the  researcher: the biosynthetic genes for a specific secondary metabolite are not  scattered over the genome, but rather are clustered in a well-defined, contiguous  region - the biosynthetic gene cluster of that metabolite. This is exemplified in  this review for the biosynthetic gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics  novobiocin, clorobiocin and coumermycin A (1), which are potent inhibitors of DNA  gyrase. Cloning, sequencing and analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters of  these three antibiotics revealed that the structural differences and similarities  of the compounds are perfectly reflected by the genetic organisation of the  biosynthetic gene clusters. The function of most biosynthetic genes could be  identified by gene inactivation experiments as well as by heterologous expression  and biochemical investigation. The prenylated benzoic acid moiety of novobiocin  and clorobiocin, involved in the interaction with gyrase, is structurally similar  to metabolites found in plants. However, detailed investigations of the  biosynthesis revealed that the biosynthetic pathway and the enzymes involved are   totally different from those identified in plants.
