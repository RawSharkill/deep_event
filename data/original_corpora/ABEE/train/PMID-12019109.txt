Overproduction and biochemical characterization of the Chryseobacterium  meningosepticum BlaB metallo-beta-lactamase. 

The BlaB metallo-beta-lactamase of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum CCUG4310 was   overproduced in Escherichia coli by means of a T7 promoter-based expression  system. The overproducing system, scaled up in a 15-liter fermentor, yielded  approximately 10 mg of BlaB protein per liter, mostly released in the culture  supernatant. The enzyme was purified by two ion-exchange chromatographic steps  with an overall yield of 66%. Analysis of the kinetic parameters revealed  efficient activities (k(cat)/K(m) ratios of >10(6) M(-1) s(-1)) toward most penam  and carbapenem compounds, with the exception of the 6-alpha-methoxypenam  derivative temocillin and of biapenem, which were poorer substrates. Hydrolysis  of cephalosporins was overall less efficient, with a remarkable variability that   was largely due to variable affinities of the BlaB enzyme for different  compounds. BlaB was also able to hydrolyze serine-beta-lactamase inhibitors,  including beta-iodopenicillanate, sulbactam and, although less efficiently,  tazobactam.
