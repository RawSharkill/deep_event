Non-active site mutation (Q123A) in New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1)  enhanced its enzyme activity. 

New Delhi metallo beta-lactamase-1 is one of the carbapenemases, causing  hydrolysis of almost all beta-lactamase antibiotics. Seventeen different NDM  variants have been reported so far, they varied in their sequences either by  single or multiple amino acid substitutions. Hence, it is important to understand  its structural and functional relation. In the earlier studies role of active  site residues has been studied but non-active site residues has not studied in  detail. Therefore, we have initiated to further comprehend its structure and  function relation by mutating some of its non-active site residues. A laboratory   mutant of NDM-1 was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, replacing Q  to A at 123 position. The MICs of imipenem and meropenem for NDM-1(Q123A) were  found increased by 2 fold as compare to wild type and so the hydrolytic activity   was enhanced (Kcat/Km) as compared to NDM-1 wild type. GOLD fitness scores were  also found in favour of kinetics data. Secondary structure for alpha-helical  content was determined by Far-UV circular dichroism (CD), which showed  significant conformational changes. We conclude a noteworthy role of  non-active-site amino acid residues in the catalytic activity of NDM-1. This  study also provides an insight of emergence of new variants through natural  evolution.
