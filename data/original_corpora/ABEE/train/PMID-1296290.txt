[Resistance of Salmonella].

The emergence and the increase of antibiotic resistant Salmonella particularly in  non-typhi species has occurred in recent years. Beside plasmid mediated  resistance, new resistance mechanisms like alterations of permeability have been   identified. Factors associated with resistance are the use of antibiotics in  human and animals. These findings have important public health implications. It  seems necessary to define a more adapted policy in human and veterinary use in  order to avoid the rapid emergence of drug-resistance among regularly active  antibiotics like fluoroquinolones.
