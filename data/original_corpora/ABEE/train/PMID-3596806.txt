Role of volatile fatty acids in colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile   in gnotobiotic mice.

Clostridium difficile is an agent involved in the development of  antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The purpose of this work was to  investigate the role of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in resistance to colonization  by C. difficile by using a gnotobiotic animal model. Accordingly, germfree mice  were associated with different hamster flora, and the VFAs in their cecal  contents were measured by gas chromatography. The results showed that VFAs were  produced mainly by the intestinal flora, especially by the strictly anaerobic  bacteria. In these associated mice, the concentrations of acetic, propionic, and   butyric acids were higher than those of other acids, but at pH 6.8 the MICs of  these three acids in vitro for C. difficile were more than 200 mu eq/ml. In  gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with C. difficile and in the isolated ceca of  these mice, VFAs did not inhibit the growth of C. difficile. In gnotobiotic mice   which were diassociated with C. difficile and C. butyricum and given drinking  water with a lactose concentration of 20%, the cecal contents included about the   same amount of butyric acid as did those of the monoassociated mice, although the  population of C. difficile remained the same. Therefore, it is suggested that  VFAs alone cannot inhibit intestinal colonization by C. difficile and that,  consequently, other inhibitory mechanisms are also present.
