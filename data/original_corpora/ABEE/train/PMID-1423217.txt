Bacterial resistance to tetracycline: mechanisms, transfer, and clinical  significance.

Tetracycline has been a widely used antibiotic because of its low toxicity and  broad spectrum of activity. However, its clinical usefulness has been declining  because of the appearance of an increasing number of tetracycline resistant  isolates of clinically important bacteria. Two types of resistance mechanisms  predominate: tetracycline efflux and ribosomal protection. A third mechanism of  resistance, tetracycline modification, has been identified, but its clinical  relevance is still unclear. For some tetracycline resistance genes, expression is  regulated. In efflux genes found in gram-negative enteric bacteria, regulation is  via a repressor that interacts with tetracycline. Gram-positive efflux genes  appear to be regulated by an attenuation mechanism. Recently it was reported that  at least one of the ribosome protection genes is regulated by attenuation.  Tetracycline resistance genes are often found on transmissible elements. Efflux  resistance genes are generally found on plasmids, whereas genes involved in  ribosome protection have been found on both plasmids and self-transmissible  chromosomal elements (conjugative transposons). One class of conjugative  transposon, originally found in streptococci, can transfer itself from  streptococci to a variety of recipients, including other gram-positive bacteria,   gram-negative bacteria, and mycoplasmas. Another class of conjugative transposons  has been found in the Bacteroides group. An unusual feature of the Bacteroides  elements is that their transfer is enhanced by preexposure to tetracycline. Thus,  tetracycline has the double effect of selecting for recipients that acquire a  resistance gene and stimulating transfer of the gene.
