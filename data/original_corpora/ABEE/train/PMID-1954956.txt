Antibiotic resistance in Haemophilus influenzae: mechanisms, clinical importance   and consequences for therapy.

Invasive and non-invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae are  frequently diagnosed in children below the age of 5 years. The treatment of  choice for these infections was ampicillin. However, since the early 1970s the  increasing prevalence of resistance to ampicillin and other antibiotics has  necessitated major changes in antibiotic therapy. This article summarizes some of  the important clinical features of diseases caused by H. influenzae. The  epidemiology, the problems with in vitro susceptibility testing and the  mechanisms of resistance to major antibiotics are reviewed. The consequences of  antibiotic resistance for the treatment of diseases caused by H. influenzae are  discussed.
