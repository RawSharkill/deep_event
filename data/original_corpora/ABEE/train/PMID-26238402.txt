Substrate-bound structure of the E. coli multidrug resistance transporter MdfA. 

Multidrug resistance is a serious threat to public health. Proton motive  force-driven antiporters from the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) constitute   a major group of multidrug-resistance transporters. Currently, no reports on  crystal structures of MFS antiporters in complex with their substrates exist. The  E. coli MdfA transporter is a well-studied model system for biochemical analyses   of multidrug-resistance MFS antiporters. Here, we report three crystal structures  of MdfA-ligand complexes at resolutions up to 2.0 A, all in the inward-facing  conformation. The substrate-binding site sits proximal to the conserved acidic  residue, D34. Our mutagenesis studies support the structural observations of the   substrate-binding mode and the notion that D34 responds to substrate binding by  adjusting its protonation status. Taken together, our data unveil the  substrate-binding mode of MFS antiporters and suggest a mechanism of transport  via this group of transporters.
