MAS solid-state NMR studies on the multidrug transporter EmrE. 

We study the uniformly 13C,15N isotopically enriched Escherichia coli multidrug  resistance transporter EmrE using MAS solid-state NMR. Solid-state NMR can  provide complementary structural information as the method allows studying  membrane proteins in their native environment as no detergent is required for  reconstitution. We compare the spectra obtained from wildtype EmrE to those  obtained from the mutant EmrE-E14C. To resolve the critical amino acid E14,  glutamic/aspartic acid selective experiments are carried out. These experiments  allow to assign the chemical shift of the carboxylic carbon of E14. In addition,   spectra are analyzed which are obtained in the presence and absence of the ligand  TPP+.
