[Molecular and epidemiological bases of bacterial resistance to antibiotics].

The emergence of resistance to antibiotics is related to the genetic determinants  of microbial resistance. The characteristics and properties of chromosomal  mutations, plasmids, transposons and the various mechanisms of resistance are  described. The range of bacterial and genetic exchanges in determining the  epidemic spread of resistance to an antibiotic are illustrated and discussed.
