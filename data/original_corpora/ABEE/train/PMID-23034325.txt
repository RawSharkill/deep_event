Adaptive and mutational resistance: role of porins and efflux pumps in drug  resistance. 

The substantial use of antibiotics in the clinic, combined with a dearth of new  antibiotic classes, has led to a gradual increase in the resistance of bacterial   pathogens to these compounds. Among the various mechanisms by which bacteria  endure the action of antibiotics, those affecting influx and efflux are of  particular importance, as they limit the interaction of the drug with its  intracellular targets and, consequently, its deleterious effects on the cell.  This review evaluates the impact of porins and efflux pumps on two major types of  resistance, namely, mutational and adaptive types of resistance, both of which  are regarded as key phenomena in the global rise of antibiotic resistance among  pathogenic microorganisms. In particular, we explain how adaptive and mutational   events can dramatically influence the outcome of antibiotic therapy by altering  the mechanisms of influx and efflux of antibiotics. The identification of porins   and pumps as major resistance markers has opened new possibilities for the  development of novel therapeutic strategies directed specifically against these  mechanisms.
