Metal ion resistance in fungi: molecular mechanisms and their regulated  expression.

One stress response in cells is the ability to survive in an environment  containing excessive concentrations of metal ions. This paper reviews current  knowledge about cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the response and  adaptation of various fungal species to metal stress. Most cells contain a  repertoire of mechanisms to maintain metal homeostasis and prevent metal  toxicity. Roles played by glutathione, related (gamma-EC)nG peptides,  metallothionein-like polypeptides, and sulfide ions are discussed. In response to  cellular metal stress, the biosynthesis of some of these molecules are  metalloregulated via intracellular metal sensors. The identify of the metal  sensors and the role of metal ions in the regulation of biosynthesis of  metallothionein and (gamma-EC)nG peptides are subjects of much current attention   and are discussed herein.
