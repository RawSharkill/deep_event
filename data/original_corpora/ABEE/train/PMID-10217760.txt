Identification and characterization of a new porin gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae:  its role in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. 

Klebsiella pneumoniae porin genes were analyzed to detect mutations accounting  for the porin deficiency observed in many beta lactam resistant strains. PCR and   Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of a third porin gene in addition  to the OmpK36 and OmpK35 porin genes previously described. This new porin gene  was designated ompK37 and is present in all of the clinical isolates tested. The   OmpK37 porin gene was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli.  In contrast to that of the major porins, OmpK37 porin expression was only  detectable by Western blot analysis in porin-deficient beta lactam resistant  strains, suggesting strong down regulation under standard laboratory conditions.   Functional characterization suggested a narrower pore for the OmpK37 porin than  for K. pneumoniae porins OmpK36 and OmpK35. This correlated with the  susceptibility to certain beta-lactam antibiotics, since a K. pneumoniae strain  expressing porin OmpK37, but not porin OmpK36 or OmpK35, was less susceptible to   beta-lactam antibiotics than the same strain expressing either porin OmpK36 or  OmpK35.
