Resistance factors in anaerobic bacteria.

Resistance transfer factors have been described in both Bacteroides and  clostridia. The clindamycin (Cln) resistance transfer factors from the  Bacteroides fragilis group of organisms have been best studied, including our own  plasmid pBFTM10. The clindamycin resistance determinant (Cln X) of pBFTM10 can be  detected in 90% of Cln resistant Bacteroides isolated from dispersed geographical  areas. This determinant can be located in the chromosome and on plasmids. Recent   studies from our laboratory have shown that the Cln X genes of pBFTM 10 are  carried on a compound transposon, Tn4400. Bacteroides plasmids have been cloned  in Escherichia coli and shuttle vectors have been developed that allow transfers   of DNA from E. coli back to B. fragilis, using the broad host range plasmid RK2  to supply essential conjugation functions. We have shown that shuttle vectors  containing pBFTM 10 can be retransferred from B. fragilis back to E. coli. In  addition, a tetracycline transfer element from B. fragilis strain TM230 is able  to promote high frequency conjugation between B. fragilis and E. coli. The  results of these investigations indicate that Bacteroides has efficient  mechanisms to exchange genetic material and that genetic exchange can occur  between Bacteroides and E. coli, which exist in intimate contact in the human  colon.
