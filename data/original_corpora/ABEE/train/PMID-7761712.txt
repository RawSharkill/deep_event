The emergence of resistant pneumococcus as a pathogen in childhood upper  respiratory tract infections.

Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most common organism causing acute  otitis media and sinusitis in infants and children and remains an important  bacterial cause of pneumonia, septic arthritis, and bacterial meningitis in the  pediatric age group. The definition, incidence, and mechanisms for penicillin  resistance in pneumococcus are reviewed here. Physicians caring for children  should know and understand these important concepts. At present, for most  respiratory infections in children penicillin resistant pneumococcus does not  represent a clinical dilemma as far as regarding alteration of empiric antibiotic  therapy. However, as this problem continues to grow, especially for patients with  recurrent otitis media or sinusitis, physicians will be facing upper respiratory   infections that are more commonly caused by these isolates and the antibiotic  management of infections in the respiratory tract caused by penicillin and other   antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal isolates will require modification.
