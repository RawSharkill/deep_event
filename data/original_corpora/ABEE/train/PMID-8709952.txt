The genetics of the repair of 5-azacytidine-mediated DNA damage in the fission  yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

We have recently demonstrated that Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells treated with  the nucleoside analogue 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) require previously characterised  G2 checkpoint mechanisms for survival. Here we present a survey of known DNA  repair mutations which defines those genes required for survival in the presence   of 5-azaC. Using a combination of single-mutant and epistasis analyses we find  that the excision, mismatch and recombinational repair pathways are all required   in some degree for the repair of 5-azaC-mediated DNA damage. There are distinct  differences in the epistatic interactions of several of the repair mutations with  respect to 5-azaC-mediated DNA damage relative to UV-mediated DNA damage.
