Identification of an efflux pump gene, pmrA, associated with fluoroquinolone  resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

An open reading frame (ORF) homologous to norA was insertionally inactivated with  cat in a fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus with an efflux phenotype; this  inactivation caused reversion to drug sensitivity. The ORF product has 24% amino   acid sequence identity each to NorA and Bmr, which suggests that it is a major  facilitator system pump of the 12-transmembrane-segment class.
