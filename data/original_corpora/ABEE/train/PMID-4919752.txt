Isolation, characterization, and genetic analysis of mutator genes in Escherichia  coli B and K-12.

Twenty-one Mut mutants were obtained from Escherichia coli B (B/UV) and K-12  (JC355) after treatment with mutagens. These Mut strains are characterized by  rates of mutation to streptomycin resistance and T-phase resistance which are  significantly higher than the parental (Mut(+)) rates. Mutator genes in 12  strains have been mapped at three locations on the E. coli chromosome: one close   to the leu locus; five close to the purA locus; and six close to cysC. In  addition, eight mutator strains derived from E. coli B/UV are still unmapped.  Some effort was made to deduce the mode of action of the mutator genes. These  isolates have been examined for possible defects in deoxyribonucleic acid repair   mechanisms (dark repair of ultraviolet damage, host-cell reactivation,  recombination ability, repair of mitomycin C damage). By using transductional  analysis, it was found that the ultraviolet sensitivity of NTG119 and its mutator  property results from two separate but closely linked mutations. PurA(+)  transductants that receive mut from NTG119 or NTG35 are all more sensitive to  mitomycin C than is the PurA recipient. Unless transduction selects for  sensitivity, a probable interpretation is that defective repair of mitomycin  C-induced damage is related to the mode of action of mut in these transductants  and the donor. Abnormal purine synthesis may be involved in the mutability of  some strains with cotransduction of the mutator properly and purA (100%  cotransduction for NTG119). Three mutators are recombination-deficient and may  have a defective step in recombination repair. One maps near three rec genes  close to cysC.
