Microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. 

Drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.   They can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging   antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new  antibacterial drugs. The design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by  knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly  understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. We  describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression,  purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the  'Major Facilitator Superfamily' (MFS) of transport proteins from Helicobacter  pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus   subtilis, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides and  Streptomyces coelicolor. The H. pylori putative drug resistance protein, HP1092,   and the S. aureus QacA proteins are used as detailed examples. This strategy is  an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the  screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to  enable subsequent structure determination.
