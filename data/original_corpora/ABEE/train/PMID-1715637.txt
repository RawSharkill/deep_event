Sensitivity of Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli bacteria to bacteriophages   and to colicins, lost or established by the acquisition of R plasmids.

Lac+ recombinant of Shigella flexneri 2a carrying R-factors of the standard set  have been constructed. The R+ transconjugants obtained have been compared with  the original strain with respect to their susceptibility to a set of  bacteriophages recommended for phagetyping of Shigella strains and to a set of  colicins. It have been found that as a result of acquiring some R-factors the  susceptibility to bacteriophages changes; presence of certain R-factors causes  susceptibility, that of other R-factors--resistance. Similar changes have been  observed in the case of susceptibility to colicins. Propable mechanisms of the  changes of susceptibility to these factors are discussed.
