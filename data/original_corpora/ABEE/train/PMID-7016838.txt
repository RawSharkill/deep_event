Inducible plasmid-determined resistance to arsenate, arsenite, and antimony (III)  in escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Plasmids in both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus contain an "operon"  that confers resistance to arsenate, arsenite, and antimony(III) salts. The  systems were always inducible. All three salts, arsenate, arsenite, and  antimony(III), were inducers. Mutants and a cloned deoxyribonucleic acid fragment  from plasmid pI258 in S. aureus have lost arsenate resistance but retained  resistances to arsenite and antimony, demonstrating that separate genes are  involved. Arsenate resistant arsenite sensitive S. aureus plasmid mutants were  also isolated. In E. coli, plasmid-determined arsenate resistance and reduced  uptake were additive to that found with chromosomal arsenate resistance mutants.   Arsenate resistance was due to reduced uptake of arsenate by the induced  plasmid-containing cells. Under conditions of high arsenate, when some uptake  could be demonstrated with the induced resistant cells, the arsenate was rapidly   lost by the cells in the absence of extracellular phosphate. Sensitive cells  retained arsenate under these conditions. When phosphate was added,  phosphate-arsenate exchange occurred. High phosphate in the growth medium  protected cells from arsenate, but not from arsenite or antimony(III) toxicity.  We do not know the mechanisms of arsenite or antimony resistance. However,  arsenite was not oxidized to less toxic arsenate. Since cell-free medium  "conditioned" by prior growth to induced resistant cells with toxic levels of  arsenite or antimony(III) retained the ability to inhibit the growth of sensitive  cells, the mechanism of arsenite and antimony resistance does not involve  conversion of AsO2- or SbO+ to less toxic forms or binding by soluble thiols  excreted by resistant cells.
