Mechanisms of natural resistance to mouse typhoid.

The early, innate resistance phase in mouse typhoid is largely controlled by a  single gene (unlike the later, polygenic immune phase), designated Ity, which may  be identical to those controlling resistance to Leishmania (Lsh) and mycobacteria  (Bcg). The gene product and its function are unknown. Athymic (nu/nu) mice showed  greater early resistance to salmonella infection than euthymic littermates, but  only if they were already naturally resistant CBA (Ityr). Athymic susceptible  Balb/c (Itys) were not different from the controls. The Ity mechanism is highly  radio-resistant: 800 R whole body irradiation does not modify the early Ity  phenotype in Balb/c and A/J mice, as measured by early in vivo net bacterial  growth; this, however, increases sharply on day 3-4, when growth curves plateau  in controls (immune response). Bone marrow radiation chimeras infected 3 months  after the transfer confirm that, while the donor genotype determines the Ity  recipient phenotype in single chimeras, double chimeras (Itys + Ityr) leads to  Ityr are susceptible or intermediate in both semiallogeneic and syngeneic models.  The typhoid relapse following cessation of antibiotic therapy was greater in  susceptible than in resistant mice. In lethally infected mice, ampicillin  decreased the bacterial load twice as fast in susceptible Balb/c than in  resistant (B10 X A/J)F1 mice, but they required much more prolonged treatment to   develop effective immunity. Considered collectively, the present data is  consistent with the view that early resistance is thymus independent and relies  on innate mechanisms present in radioresistant bone marrow derived cells that in   some way provide an environment which favours a more rapid in vivo division rate   of the organism in susceptible mice.
