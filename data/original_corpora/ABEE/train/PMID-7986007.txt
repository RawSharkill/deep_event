Genetic relationship between soxRS and mar loci in promoting multiple antibiotic   resistance in Escherichia coli.

Multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli has typically been associated   with mutations at the mar locus, located at 34 min on the E. coli chromosome. A  new mutant, marC, isolated on the basis of a Mar phenotype but which maps to the   soxRS (encoding the regulators of the superoxide stress response) locus located  at 92 min, is described here. This mutant shares several features with a known  constitutive allele of the soxRS gene, prompting the conclusion that it is a  highly active allele of this gene. The marC mutation has thus been given the  designation soxR201. This new mutant was used to examine the relationship between  the mar and sox loci in promoting antibiotic resistance. The results of these  studies indicate that full antibiotic resistance resulting from the soxR201  mutation is partially dependent on an intact mar locus and is associated with an   increase in the steady-state level of mar-specific mRNA. In addition, paraquat  treatment of wild-type cells is shown to increase the level of antibiotic  resistance in a dose-dependent manner that requires an intact soxRS locus.  Conversely, overexpression of MarA from a multicopy plasmid results in weak  activation of a superoxide stress response target gene. These findings are  consistent with a model in which the regulatory factors encoded by the marA and  soxS genes control the expression of overlapping sets of target genes, with MarA   preferentially acting on targets involved with antibiotic resistance and SoxS  directed primarily towards components of the superoxide stress response.  Furthermore, compounds frequently used to induce the superoxide stress response,   including paraquat, menadione, and phenazine methosulfate, differ with respect to  the amount of protection provided against them by the antibiotic resistance  response.
