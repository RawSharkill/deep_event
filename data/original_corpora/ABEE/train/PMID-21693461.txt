Inhibition of DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV of Staphylococcus aureus and  Escherichia coli by aminocoumarin antibiotics. 

OBJECTIVES: Aminocoumarin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA  gyrase. We investigated the inhibitory and antibacterial activity of naturally  occurring aminocoumarin antibiotics and six structural analogues (novclobiocins)   against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV from Escherichia coli and  Staphylococcus aureus as well as the effect of potassium and sodium glutamate on   the activity of these enzymes. METHODS: The inhibitory concentrations of the  aminocoumarins were determined in gyrase supercoiling assays and topoisomerase IV  decatenation assays. Both subunits of S. aureus topoisomerase IV were purified as  His-Tag proteins in E. coli. The MIC was tested in vivo for the control organisms  E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. RESULTS: DNA gyrase is the primary  target in vitro of all investigated aminocoumarins. With the exception of  simocyclinone D8, all other aminocoumarins inhibited S. aureus gyrase on average   6-fold more effectively than E. coli gyrase. Potassium glutamate is essential for  the activity of S. aureus gyrase and increases the sensitivity of E. coli gyrase   to aminocoumarins >/= 10-fold. The antibacterial activity of the tested compounds  mirrored their relative activities against topoisomerases. CONCLUSIONS: The study  provides insights about the substituents that are important for the inhibitory  activity of aminocoumarins against the target enzymes, which will facilitate the   rational design of improved antibiotics.
