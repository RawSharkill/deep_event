[Problems of bacterial infections of the sinuses (author's transl)].

Mechanisms of bacterial infections as well as problems of antibiotic therapy are   discussed with particular reference to the human sinuses. Infectious diseases  lost their importance as a result of modern chemotherapy. Wrong handling or  misunderstanding of antibiotic agents, however, may give rise to new important  problems in antibiotic therapy as a result of increasing resistance.
