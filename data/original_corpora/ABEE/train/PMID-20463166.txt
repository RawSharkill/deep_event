Multilocus sequence types of carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in  Singapore carrying metallo-beta-lactamase genes, including the novel bla(IMP-26)   gene. 

Nine imipenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were found to contain a  variety of metallo-beta-lactamase genes, including bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-7),  bla(VIM-2), bla(VIM-6), and the novel bla(IMP-26). Multilocus sequence typing  showed a diversity of sequence types. Comparison with isolates from an earlier  study showed that the epidemic clones from 2000 have not become established.
