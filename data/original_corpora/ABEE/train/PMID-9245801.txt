The MtrD protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a member of the  resistance/nodulation/division protein family constituting part of an efflux  system. 

The mtr (multiple transferable resistance) system of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  mediates resistance of gonococci to structurally diverse hydrophobic agents (HAs)  through an energy-dependent efflux process. Recently, complete or partial ORFs  that encode membrane proteins (MtrC, MtrD, MtrE) forming an efflux pump  responsible for removal of HAs from gonococci were identified and appeared to  constitute a single transcriptional unit. In this study, the complete nucleotide   sequence of the mtrD gene was determined, permitting the characterization of the   MtrD protein. The full-length MtrD protein has a predicted molecular mass of  nearly 114 kDa, putatively containing a 56 amino acid signal peptide. MtrD  displays significant amino acid sequence similarity to a family of cytoplasmic  membrane proteins, termed resistance/nodulation/division (RND) proteins, which  function as energy-dependent transporters of antibacterial agents and secrete  bacterial products to the extracellular fluid. The predicted topology of the MtrD  transporter protein revealed 12 potential membrane-spanning domains, which were  clustered within the central and C-terminal regions of the primary sequence. Loss  of MtrD due to insertional inactivation of the mtrD gene rendered gonococci  hypersusceptible to several structurally diverse HAs, including two fatty acids  (capric acid and palmitic acid) and a bile salt (cholic acid), but not  hydrophilic antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and streptomycin. Since gonococci  often infect mucosal sites rich in toxic fatty acids and bile salts, the  expression of the mtr efflux system may promote growth of gonococci under hostile  conditions encountered in vivo.
