Molecular mechanisms of copper resistance and accumulation in bacteria.

An unusual mechanism of metal resistance is found in certain plant pathogenic  strains of Pseudomonas syringae that are exposed to high levels of copper  compounds used in disease control on agricultural crops. These bacteria  accumulate blue Cu2+ ions in the periplasm and outer membrane. At least part of  this copper sequestering activity is determined by copper-binding protein  products of the copper resistance operon (cop). Potential copper-binding sites of  the periplasmic CopA protein show conservation with type-1, type-2, and type-3  copper sites of several eukaryotic multi-copper oxidases. In addition to  compartmentalization of copper in the periplasm, two components of the cop  operon, copC and copD, appear to function in copper uptake into the cytoplasm.  Copper resistance operons related to cop have been described in the related plant  pathogen Xanthomonas campestris and in Escherichia coli, but these resistance  systems may differ functionally from the Pseudomonas syringae system.
