New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: local acquisition in Ontario, Canada, and  challenges in detection. 

New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a recently identified  metallo-beta-lactamase that confers resistance to carbapenems and all other  beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of aztreonam. NDM-1 is also  associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The enzyme was  first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in Sweden who had  previously received medical treatment in India, but it is now recognized as  endemic throughout India and Pakistan and has spread worldwide. The gene encoding  NDM-1 has been found predominantly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.  We describe the isolation NDM-1-producing organisms from two patients in Toronto,  Ontario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism  producing NDM-1 that was locally acquired in Canada. We also discuss the evidence  that NDM-1 can affect bacterial species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the  limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting  organisms that produce NDM-1.
