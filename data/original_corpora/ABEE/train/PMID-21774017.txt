Crystal structure of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase reveals molecular basis for  antibiotic resistance. 

beta-Lactams are the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics and have had  an enormous impact on human health. Thus, it is disquieting that an enzyme called  New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) can confer Enterobacteriaceae with  nearly complete resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics including the  carbapenams. We have determined the crystal structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae  apo-NDM-1 to 2.1-A resolution. From the structure, we see that NDM-1 has an  expansive active site with a unique electrostatic profile, which we propose leads  to a broader substrate specificity. In addition, NDM-1 undergoes important  conformational changes upon substrate binding. These changes have not been  previously observed in metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes and may have a direct  influence on substrate recognition and catalysis.
