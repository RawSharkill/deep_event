Multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a retrospective katG and rpoB  mutation profile analysis in isolates from a reference center in Brazil. 

BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance is a critical factor in tuberculosis control. To  gain better understanding of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Brazil, a  retrospective study was performed to compare genotypic diversity and drug  resistance associated mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a  national reference center. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Ninety-nine multidrug resistant   isolates from 12 Brazilian states were studied. Drug-resistance patterns were  determined and the rpoB and katG genes were screened for mutations. Genotypic  diversity was investigated by IS6110-RFLP and Luminex 47 spoligotyping. Mutations  in rpoB and katG were seen in 91% and 93% of the isolates, respectively. Codon  315 katG mutations occurred in 82.8% of the isolates with a predominance of the  Ser315Thr substitution. Twenty-five isolates were clustered in 11 groups with  identical IS6110-RFLP patterns while 74 showed unique patterns with no  association between mutation frequencies or susceptibility profiles. The most  prevalent spoligotyping lineages were LAM (47%), T (17%) and Haarlen (12%). The  Haarlen lineage showed a higher frequency of codon 516 rpoB mutations while codon  531 mutations prevailed in the other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that  there were no major multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis strains transmitted among  patients referred to the reference center, indicating an independent acquisition   of resistance. In addition, drug resistance associated mutation profiles were  well established among the main spoligotyping lineages found in these Brazilian  multidrug resistant isolates, providing useful data for patient management and  treatment.
