Role of extracellular iron in the action of the quinone antibiotic streptonigrin:  mechanisms of killing and resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

The quinone antibiotic streptonigrin is believed to kill bacteria by promoting  formation of oxygen radicals. This antibiotic has also been used to select  resistant bacterial mutants, some of which vary in iron utilization. We examined   the effects of streptonigrin on Neisseria gonorrhoeae and several types of  gonococcal mutants. Streptonigrin (0.025 microgram/ml) efficiently killed  gonococcal strain FA1090, and this effect depended on iron.  Streptonigrin resistant mutant FA6271 had normal iron uptake but was moderately  deficient in total iron. Resistance most likely resulted from failure of FA6271  to divert electrons to streptonigrin, as demonstrated by a reduction in  KCN-insensitive respiration (a hallmark of the action of quinones) and superoxide  formation. Other mutants selected for inability to use human iron-binding  proteins (strains FA6273 and FA6275) had no increase in streptonigrin MIC and no   decrease in KCN-insensitive respiration. Mutants did not demonstrate an increase   in superoxide dismutase or catalase. Streptonigrin killing of gonococci depended   on a reaction(s) in which extracellular iron was important, presumably because  iron was required for catalysis of hydroxyl radical. The results suggest that a  membrane component may be a target for the actions of streptonigrin.
