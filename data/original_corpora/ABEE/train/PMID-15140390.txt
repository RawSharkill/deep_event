Integron-associated antibiotic resistance in enteroaggregative and enteroinvasive  Escherichia coli. 

Ten enteroinvasive (EIEC) and 25 enteroaggregative (EaggEC) E. coli strains  isolated from Senegalese patients were analyzed for their integron content. All  strains were resistant to at least two antibiotics. Four EIEC and 15 EaggEC were   found to carry a class 1 integron. An identical integron carrying a single dfrA5   cassette, conferring resistance to trimethoprim, was identified in all four EIEC   strains. Five EaggEC strains harbored an integron with a single cassette, dfrA7,   while the remaining 10 strains carried two integrons, one with a single cassette,  aadA1a conferring resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, and the second  one bearing two cassettes, dfrA13 and oxa5, the later being a beta-lactam  resistance cassette. The presence of these integrons is worrying, because  trimethoprim is largely used for diarrheal disease therapy in Africa. Thus, the  presence of integrons in diarrheagenic strains is of public health importance  because a limited number of antibiotics are available in developing countries.
