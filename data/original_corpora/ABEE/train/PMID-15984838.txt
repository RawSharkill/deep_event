Probing the breadth of macrolide glycosyltransferases: in vitro remodeling of a  polyketide antibiotic creates active bacterial uptake and enhances potency. 

The glycan portion of macrolide antibiotics modulates their efficacy. High-level   expression of three macrolide GTs and kinetic analysis has revealed a highly  selective synthetic "tool kit" with such plasticity that 12 glycan-modified  macrolide antibiotics have been readily created. One of these (1-Gal) is enhanced  over its parent oleandomycin (1) by "glycotargeting", allowing higher uptake  through active internalization by virtue of the attachment of a glycan (Gal) not   normally found on 1. Subsequent release of the targeting glycan by endogenous  galactosidase activity releases 1.
