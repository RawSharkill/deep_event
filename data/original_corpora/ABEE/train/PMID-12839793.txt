Identification of a new ribosomal protection type of tetracycline resistance  gene, tet(36), from swine manure pits. 

Previously, only one ribosome protection type of a tetracycline resistance gene,   tetQ, had been identified in Bacteroides spp. During an investigation of  anaerobic bacteria present in swine feces and manure storage pits, a  tetracycline resistant Bacteroides strain was isolated. Subsequent analysis  showed that this new Bacteroides strain, Bacteroides sp. strain 139, did not  contain tetQ but contained a previously unidentified tetracycline resistance  gene. Sequence analysis showed that the tetracycline resistance gene from  Bacteroides sp. strain 139 encoded a protein (designated Tet 36) that defines a  new class of ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance. Tet 36 has 60%  amino acid identity over 640 aa to TetQ and between 31 and 49% amino acid  identity to the nine other ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance  genes. The tet(36) region was not observed to transfer from Bacteroides sp.  strain 139 to another Bacteroides sp. under laboratory conditions. Yet tet(36)  was found in other genera of bacteria isolated from the same swine manure pits  and from swine feces. Phylogenetic analysis of the tet(36)-containing isolates  indicated that tet(36) was present not only in the  Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides group to which Bacteroides sp. strain 139  belongs but also in gram-positive genera and gram-negative proteobacteria,  indicating that horizontal transfer of tet(36) is occurring between these  divergent phylogenetic groups in the farm environment.
