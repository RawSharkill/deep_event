Antibiotic resistance mechanisms in Salmonella species causing bacteraemia in  Malawi and Kenya.

In two studies on the causative agents of bacteraemia in Malawi and Kenya, 33  Salmonella strains were isolated. Fourteen strains of Salmonella typhimurium and   Salmonella enteritidis were found to exhibit resistance to amoxicillin,  amoxicillin clavulanic acid and cotrimoxazole as well as decreased susceptibility  to a range of aminoglycosides. The resistant strains were studied to establish  their resistance mechanisms. Beta-lactamase co-focusing with TEM-1 was present in  12 strains. In two strains, both S. typhimurium from Kenya, an OXA-1  beta-lactamase was detected. The aminoglycoside modifying enzyme ANT(2") was  found in 10 strains. The presence of the encoding genes was confirmed by PCR. For  comparison, susceptibility records of 73 Salmonella strains isolated during the  past 14 years in our hospital were studied retrospectively. Only one of these  strains was resistant to amoxicillin. This resistance was acquired during  therapy.
