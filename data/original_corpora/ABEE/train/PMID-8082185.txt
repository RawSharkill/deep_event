Isolation and characterization of three mutants with increased sensitivity to  photoactivated 3-carbethoxypsoralen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The complementation and genetical analysis of yeast mutants sensitive to  photoactivated 3-carbethoxypsoralen define three novel recessive mutant alleles  pso5-1, pso6-1, and pso7-1. Their cross-sensitivity to UV254nm, radiomimetic  mutagens, and to chemicals enhancing oxidative stress suggest that these mutants   are either impaired in metabolic steps protecting from oxidative stress or in  mechanisms of the repair of oxygen-dependent DNA lesions. None of the three novel  mutant alleles block the induction of reverse mutation by photoactivated mono-  and bi-functional psoralens, nitrogen mustards, or UV254nm.
