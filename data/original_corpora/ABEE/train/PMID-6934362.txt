Galactokinase-deficient mutants of Tetrahymena thermophila: selection and  characterization.

We have isolated a series of mutants of Tetrahymena thermophila which are  resistant to inhibition of growth by the galactose analog, 2-deoxygalactose.  These mutants were obtained after mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine and the  induction of cytogamy to permit the recovery of recessive mutations induced in  the germline micronucleus. Resistance to 2-deoxygalactose is correlated with a  decreased rate of growth in galactose minimal medium and greatly reduced levels  of galactokinase. The resistant phenotype of the mutants is apparently due to the  galactokinase deficiency, which prevents the accumulation of toxic phosphorylated  metabolites of 2-deoxygalactose. Genetic analyses reveal that the  2-deoxygalactose resistance alleles segregate as single Mendelian loci. The  galactokinase-deficient strains described here represent the first mutants in  this organism for which the biochemical basis of the mutant phenotype is known.  These mutants, as well as others isolated similarly, should be of value in the  elucidation of the mechanisms governing galactokinase gene regulation and in  improving techniques of selection for other recessive mutations in Tetrahymena.
