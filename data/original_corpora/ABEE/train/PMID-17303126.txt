Structure of the multidrug ABC transporter Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus in   complex with AMP-PNP. 

Staphylococcus aureus Sav1866 is a bacterial homolog of the human ABC transporter  Mdr1 that causes multidrug resistance in cancer cells. We report the crystal  structure of Sav1866 in complex with adenosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate   (AMP-PNP) at 3.4A resolution and compare it with the previously determined  structure of Sav1866 with bound ADP. Besides differences in the ATP-binding  sites, no significant conformational changes were observed. The results confirm  that the ATP-bound state of multidrug ABC transporters is coupled to an  outward-facing conformation of the transmembrane domains.
