Characterization of poxtA, a novel phenicol oxazolidinone tetracycline resistance  gene from an MRSA of clinical origin. 

Objectives: To characterize a novel phenicol oxazolidinone tetracycline  resistance gene, named poxtA, identified in a previously described MRSA strain  that was highly resistant to linezolid and also carried the cfr gene. Methods:  The poxtA gene was identified by bioinformatic analysis of the whole genome  sequence of Staphylococcus aureus AOUC-0915. The poxtA gene was cloned in a  shuttle plasmid vector and expressed in Escherichia coli, S. aureus and  Enterococcus faecalis to investigate the protein function. Comparative sequence  analyses at the protein and genetic levels were carried out using standard  procedures. Results: The poxtA gene encodes a protein that is 32% identical to  OptrA and exhibits structural features typical of the F lineage of the  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily that cause antibiotic resistance  by ribosomal protection. Expression of poxtA in E. coli, S. aureus and E.  faecalis was able to decrease susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones and  tetracyclines. A database search identified the presence of poxtA in E. faecalis,  Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus acidilactici strains, mostly of animal  origin, and revealed the presence of poxtA homologues in the genomes of some  Clostridiales. Analysis of the genetic context revealed that poxtA was located in  a composite transposon-like structure containing two IS1216 elements.  Conclusions: A novel resistance gene, named poxtA, encoding a protein of the  antibiotic resistance (ARE) ABC-F lineage, was identified in the genome of an  MRSA of clinical origin. PoxtA can confer decreased susceptibility to phenicols,   oxazolidinones and tetracyclines and is associated with a putative mobile element  that could contribute to its horizontal dissemination.
