Clinical involvement of Aeromonas hydrophila.

Aeromonas hydrophila has for some time been regarded as an opportunistic pathogen  in hosts with impaired local or general defence mechanisms. Infections in such  individuals are generally severe. The organism is also being isolated with  increasing frequency throughout the world from a variety of focal and systemic  infections of varying severity in persons that are apparently immunologically  normal. Most commonly it causes acute diarrheal disease by producing an  enterotoxin. Thus the organism appears to have greater clinical significance that  was hitherto suspected. The organism has been infrequently reported from humans  in Canada, but its correct laboratory identification, together with increased  awareness that it can contribute to illness, will undoubtedly lead to more  reports of its isolation in Canada.
