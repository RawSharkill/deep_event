Multidrug efflux pumps and resistance: regulation and evolution. 

Multidrug transporters have long puzzled researchers because of their ability to   extrude multiple structurally dissimilar toxic chemotherapeutic agents. They  appear to be essentially ubiquitous with many microorganisms possessing large  arsenals of predicted multidrug efflux transporters. Recent reports on the  structures of multidrug efflux transporters and their cognate regulators have  suggested that the basis of multidrug recognition is the presence of large  flexible hydrophobic cavities capable of accommodating different compounds that  are bound via hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions. This structural  data provides the context for understanding other questions about the evolution  of multidrug transporters and their natural physiological roles.
