Control of the AcrAB multidrug efflux pump by quorum-sensing regulator SdiA. 

SdiA is an Escherichia coli protein that regulates cell division in a cell  density-dependent, or quorum-sensing, manner. We report that SdiA also controls  multidrug resistance by positively regulating the multidrug resistance pump  AcrAB. Overproduction of SdiA confers multidrug resistance and increased levels  of AcrAB. Conversely, sdiA null mutants are hypersensitive to drugs and have  decreased levels of AcrB protein. Our findings provide a link between quorum  sensing and multidrug efflux. Combined with previously published reports, our  data support a model in which a role of drug efflux pumps is to mediate cell-cell  communication in response to cell density. Xenobiotics expelled by pumps may  resemble the communication molecules that they normally efflux.
