Investigation of cadmium resistance in an Alcaligenes sp.

The mechanisms of metal resistance of a cadmium-resistant Alcaligenes sp. were  studied. Growth in a defined medium was unaffected by cadmium at concentrations  up to 0.1 mM, while at concentrations up to 2.5 mM, growth occurred after an  extended lag phase. The increase in length of the lag phase was abolished by  repeated subculturing at these higher concentrations. However, subculture in the   absence of cadmium reversed the adaptation process. Plasmid DNA was not detected   in adapted cells, suggesting that adaptation is not plasmid mediated. Increased  sulfide production in response to cadmium was observed, although the levels were   too low to account fully for cadmium resistance. Adaptation of cells to cadmium  resulted in the appearance of a major new membrane protein (molecular weight,  34,500) whose presence was not dependent upon the method of membrane preparation.  This protein was induced at cadmium concentrations of 0.1 mM and above, but below  this level the protein was absent. The onset of growth at concentrations above  0.1 mM was coincident with the appearance of this protein, which was also induced  by zinc (0.4 mM) but not by manganese or nickel. The protein was only solubilized  by a sodium dodecyl sulfate-2-mercaptoethanol mixture. Similar solubility  properties were shown by a second major membrane protein (molecular weight,  33,000). These two proteins proved to be similar by peptide-mapping experiments  and amino acid analysis. The appearance of the 34,500-molecular-weight protein  and its possible role in cadmium resistance are discussed.
