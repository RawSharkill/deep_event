Family of class 1 integrons related to In4 from Tn1696. 

The class 1 integron In28, found in the multidrug resistance transposon Tn1403,  was found to be located in the res site of the backbone transposon and is flanked  by a 5-bp direct duplication, indicating that it reached this position by  transposition. In28 has a backbone structure related to that of In4, but has lost  internal sequences, including the sul1 gene, due to an IS6100-mediated deletion.   In28 also lacks the partial copy of IS6100 found in In4 and contains different  gene cassettes, blaP1, cmlA1, and aadA1. In1, the class 1 integron found in the  multidrug resistance plasmid R46, is also located in a putative res site and  belongs to the In4 group. In1 has a shorter internal deletion than In28 and has  also lost one end. Additional integrons with structures related to In4 were also   found in databases, and most of them had also lost either one end or internal  regions or both. Tn610 belongs to this group.
