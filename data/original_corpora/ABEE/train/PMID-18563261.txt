Structural basis for the broad-spectrum inhibition of metallo-beta-lactamases by   thiols. 

The development of broad-spectrum metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) inhibitors is  challenging due to structural diversity and differences in metal utilisation by  these enzymes. Analysis of structural data, followed by non-denturing mass  spectrometric analyses, identified thiols proposed to inhibit representative MBLs  from all three sub-classes: B1, B2 and B3. Solution analyses led to the  identification of broad spectrum inhibitors, including potent inhibitors of the  CphA MBL (Aeromonas hydrophila). Structural studies revealed that, as observed  for other B1 and B3 MBLs, inhibition of the L1 MBL thiols involves metal  chelation. Evidence is reported that this is not the case for inhibition of the  CphA enzyme by some thiols; the crystal structure of the CphA-Zn-inhibitor  complex reveals a binding mode in which the thiol does not interact with the  zinc. The structural data enabled the design and the production of further more  potent inhibitors. Overall the results suggest that the development of reasonably  broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors should be possible.
