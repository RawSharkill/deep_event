Diversity of the Tetracycline Mobilome within a Chinese Pig Manure Sample.

Tetracycline antibiotics are widely used in livestock, and tetracycline  resistance genes (TRG) are frequently reported in the manure of farmed animals.  However, the diversity of TRG-carrying transposons in manure has still been  rarely investigated. Using a culture-free functional metagenomic procedure,  combined with large-insert library construction and sequencing, bioinformatic  analyses, and functional experiments, we identified 17 distinct TRGs in a single   pig manure sample, including two new tet genes: tet(59), encoding a tetracycline   efflux pump, and tet(W/N/W), encoding mosaic ribosomal protection. Our study also  revealed six new TRG-carrying putative nonconjugative transposons: Tn5706-like  transposon Tn6298, IS200/605-related transposon Tn6303, Tn3 family transposon  Tn6299, and three ISCR2-related transposons, Tn62300, Tn62301, and Tn62302  IMPORTANCE: Fertilization of agricultural fields with animal manure is believed  to play a major role in antibiotic resistance dissemination in the environment.  There is growing concern for the possible spread of antibiotic resistance from  the environment to humans since genetic resistance determinants may be located in  transposons and other mobile genetic elements potentially transferable to  pathogens. Among the various antibiotic resistance genes found in manure,  tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) are some of the most common. The present  study provides a detailed snapshot of the tetracycline mobilome in a single pig  manure sample, revealing an unappreciated diversity of TRGs and potential TRG  mobility vectors. Our precise identification of the TRG-carrying units will  enable us to investigate in more details their mobility effectiveness.
