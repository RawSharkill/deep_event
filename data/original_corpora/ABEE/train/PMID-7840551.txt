Possible role of insertion sequence IS257 in dissemination and expression of  high- and low-level trimethoprim resistance in staphylococci.

The transposon-like structure Tn4003 and related elements were found to encode  high- and low-level trimethoprim resistance (Tpr) in Staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci. By using transcriptional fusions in Escherichia  coli, the variation in resistance levels was found to correlate with the  transcriptional activity of the region presumed to carry the promoter for the  operon containing the Tpr dihydrofolate reductase gene, dfrA, encoded by these  elements. The reduced transcriptional activities exhibited by elements encoding  low-level Tpr appear to be a consequence of deletions adjacent to the copy of  IS257 which normally encodes the -35 sequences of these promoters. The data  obtained not only support the involvement of IS257 in the transcription of the  proposed thyE-dfrA-orf-140 operon of Tn4003 but may also implicate this insertion  sequence in the mechanisms resulting in the variation in Tpr levels observed in  staphylococci.
