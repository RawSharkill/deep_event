Biochemical studies of pyrithiamine resistant mutants of Escherichia coli K12.

The biochemical properties of strains (PT-R101 and PT-R108) of Escherichia coli  K12 resistant to growth inhibition by pyrithiamine, and antimetabolite of  thiamine, have been studied. Intracellular thiamine pyrophosphate concentration  in these resistant strains was slightly but definitely higher than that in the  parent strain. Thiamine synthesis from the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties of  thiamine by cell suspensions was greater in the resistant strains than the parent  strain. The activities of enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis in these  pyrithiamine resistant strains were 2-3 times higher than the parent strain  (3301), except for thiamine phosphate kinase, which was indetectable in in vitro   assay of the activity. However, other evidence indicates that this enzyme is not   defective but is functioning in vivo and, furthermore, that the negligible  activity of this enzyme did not affect the growth rate of the mutants. The  activities of these enzymes were further enhanced when PT-R101 was grown on 5mM  adenine and were reduced almost to zero when the strain was grown on 0.1 muM  thiamine in the same way as the parent strain. However, when these resistant  strains were grown on a low concentration of thiamine such as 0,05 muM, thiamine   synthesis by cell suspensions also decreased, but only to a limited extent  compared with the parent strain. These results suggest that PT-R101 and PT-R108  are altered in the mechanisms of regulation of thiamine biosynthesis. Their  altered properties might be due to a reduced binding affinity of the repressor  protein, which is involved on the regulation of thiamine synthesis, for the  corepressor, thiamine pyrophosphate,
