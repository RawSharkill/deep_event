Cloning, sequencing, and enhanced expression of the dihydropteroate synthase gene  of Escherichia coli MC4100. 

The Escherichia coli gene coding for dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) has been  cloned and sequenced. The protein has 282 amino acids and a compositional  molecular mass of 30,314 daltons. Increased expression of the enzyme was realized  by using a T7 expression system. The enzyme was purified and crystallized. A  temperature-sensitive mutant was isolated and found to express a DHPS with a  lower specific activity and lower affinities for para-aminobenzoic acid and  sulfathiazole. The allele had a point mutation that changed a phenylalanine codon  to a leucine codon, and the mutation was in a codon that is conserved among  published DHPS sequences.
