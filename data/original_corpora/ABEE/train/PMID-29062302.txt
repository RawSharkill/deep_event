Genetic Background and Expression of the New qepA4 Gene Variant Recovered in  Clinical TEM-1- and CMY-2-Producing Escherichia coli. 

A new QepA4 variant was detected in an O86:H28 ST156-fimH38 Escherichia coli,  showing a multidrug-resistance phenotype. PAbetaN inhibition of qepA4-harboring  transconjugant resulted in increase of nalidixic acid accumulation. The qepA4 and  catA1 genes were clustered in a 26.0-kp contig matching an IncF-type plasmid, and  containing a Tn21-type transposon with multiple mobile genetic elements. This  QepA variant is worrisome because these determinants might facilitate the  selection of higher-level resistance mutants, playing a role in the development  of resistance, and/or confer higher-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in  association with chromosomal mutations.
