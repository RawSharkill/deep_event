Characterization of a novel porin protein from Moraxella catarrhalis and  identification of an immunodominant surface loop. 

Moraxella catarrhalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is mainly responsible for  respiratory tract infections. In this study we report a novel outer membrane  protein (OMP), designated M35, with a molecular mass of 36.1 kDa. This protein  was structurally homologous to classic gram-negative porins, such as OMP C from  Escherichia coli and OMP K36 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a predicted  structure of 8 surface loops and 16 antiparallel beta-sheets. The DNA sequences  of the genes from 18 diverse clinical isolates showed that the gene was highly  conserved (99.6 to 100% of nucleotides), with only one isolate (ID78LN266) having  base variations that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Electrophoresis and  analysis of recognition of the protein using mouse anti-M35 sera showed that M35   was expressed on the bacterial surface and constitutively expressed across M.  catarrhalis isolates, with only ID78LN266 showing poor antibody recognition. Our   results showed that the single amino acid mutation in loop 3 significantly  affected antibody recognition, indicating that loop 3 appeared to contain an  immunodominant B-cell epitope. The antibody specificity to loop 3 may be a  potential mechanism for evasion of host immune responses targeted to M35, since  loop 3 should theoretically orientate into the porin channel. Thus, M35 is a  highly conserved, surface-expressed protein that is of significance for its  potential functional role as an M. catarrhalis porin and is of interest as a  vaccine candidate.
