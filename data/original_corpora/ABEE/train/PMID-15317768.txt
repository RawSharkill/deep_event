Bacillus subtilis LmrA is a repressor of the lmrAB and yxaGH operons:  identification of its binding site and functional analysis of lmrB and yxaGH.

The Bacillus subtilis lmrAB operon is involved in multidrug resistance. LmrA is a  repressor of its own operon, while LmrB acts as a multidrug efflux transporter.  LmrA was produced in Escherichia coli cells and was shown to bind to the lmr  promoter region, in which an LmrA-binding site was identified. Genome-wide  screening involving DNA microarray analysis allowed us to conclude that LmrA also  repressed yxaGH, which was not likely to contribute to the multidrug resistance.   LmrA bound to a putative yxaGH promoter region, in which two tandem LmrA-binding   sites were identified. The LmrA regulon was thus determined to comprise lmrAB and  yxaGH. All three LmrA-binding sites contained an 18-bp consensus sequence,  TAGACCRKTCWMTATAWT, which could play an important role in LmrA binding.
