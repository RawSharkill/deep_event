[Genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in gram negative bacteria].

Modern data on spreading, structural and functional organization and evolution of  the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in the gram-negative bacteria  are reviewed. Some mechanisms for resistance to trimethoprime, sulphonamides,  tetracyclines, chloramphenicol aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics  controlled by the plasmid and chromosomal genes are presented. The problem of  using the molecular DNA-probes containing the genetical determinants for  antibiotic resistance in the practical work of clinical laboratories is  discussed.
