Genetic analyses of sulfonamide resistance and its dissemination in gram-negative  bacteria illustrate new aspects of R plasmid evolution.

In contrast to what has been observed for many other antibiotic resistance  mechanisms, there are only two known genes encoding plasmid-borne sulfonamide  resistance. Both genes, sulI and sulII, encode a drug-resistant dihydropteroate  synthase enzyme. In members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from  several worldwide sources, plasmid-mediated resistance to sulfonamides could be  identified by colony hybridization as being encoded by sulI, sulII, or both. The   sulI gene was in all cases found to be located in the newly defined, mobile  genetic element, recently named an integron, which has been shown to contain a  site-specific recombination system for the integration of various antibiotic  resistance genes. The sulII gene was almost exclusively found as part of a  variable resistance region on small, nonconjugative plasmids. Colony  hybridization to an intragenic probe, restriction enzyme digestion, and  nucleotide sequence analysis of small plasmids indicated that the sulII gene and   contiguous sequences represent an independently occurring region disseminated in   the bacterial population. The sulII resistance region was bordered by direct  repeats, which in some plasmids were totally or partially deleted. The prevalence  of sulI and sulII could thus be accounted for by their stable integration in  transposons and in plasmids that are widely disseminated among gram-negative  bacteria.
