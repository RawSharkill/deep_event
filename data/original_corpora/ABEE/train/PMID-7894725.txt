Variation of the flagellin gene locus of Campylobacter jejuni by recombination  and horizontal gene transfer.

The capacity of Campylobacter jejuni to generate genetic diversity was determined  for its flagellar region. Recombination within a genome, as well as recombination  after the uptake of exogenous DNA, could be demonstrated. The subunit of the  flagellar filament of C. jejuni is encoded by two tandem genes, flaA and flaB,  which are highly similar and therefore subject to recombination. A spontaneous  recombination within this locus was demonstrated in a bacterial clone containing   an antibiotic-resistance gene inserted in flaA. A recombinant was isolated in  which the antibiotic-resistance gene had been repositioned into flaB, indicating   that genetic information can be exchanged between the two flagellin genes of C.  jejuni. The occurrence of recombinational events after the uptake of exogenous  DNA by naturally competent bacteria was demonstrated with two mutants containing   different antibiotic-resistance markers in their flagellin genes.  Double-resistant transformants were formed when purified chromosomal donor DNA  was added to a recipient strain, when the two bacterial cultures were mixed under  conditions that induce natural competence, or when the two strains were  cocultured. Both mechanisms of recombination may be used by the pathogenic  organism to escape the immunological responses of the host or otherwise adapt to   the environment.
