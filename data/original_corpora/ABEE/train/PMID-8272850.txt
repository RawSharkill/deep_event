Use of DNA probes and plasmid capture in a search for new interesting  environmental genes.

Adaptation to a stressed environment leads to organisms bearing DNA, encoding  defense mechanisms. These mechanisms can be heavy metal resistance, catabolism of  organic xenobiotics or stress reactions. Genes responsible for these mechanisms  can be used for monitoring changing environments and therefore it can be  important to store such bacteria in a bank. DNA-probing will be presented by the   use of DNA fragments (of Alcaligenes eutrophus) coding for heavy metal resistance  or xenobiotic degradation. Some strains do not grow on petri dishes and  accordingly cannot be isolated from soils. In order to isolate plasmids from such  strains, coding for heavy metal resistances or xenobiotic degradations, an  exogenous plasmid isolation method was developed. In this method, the endogenous   population is conjugated with Pseudomonas or Alcaligenes strains bearing a  retrotransfer plasmid like RP4. In that way new plasmids from various sources  including non-culturable strains could be obtained. With these methods, a large  number of specimens adapted to stressed situations can be isolated or constructed  (in the case of the exogenous plasmid isolation method). They form a source of  interesting genetic material that can be used to restore polluted areas in  natural areas, if necessary with the aid of genetic engineering (in vitro or in  vivo techniques). Full knowledge of such bacteria and their resistance mechanisms  or degradation pathways, can lead to new constructions able to attack  recalcitrant mixtures of different organics and to resist heavy metals.
