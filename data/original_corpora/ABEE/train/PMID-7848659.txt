Resistance to arsenic compounds in microorganisms.

Arsenic ions, frequently present as environmental pollutants, are very toxic for   most microorganisms. Some microbial strains possess genetic determinants that  confer resistance. In bacteria, these determinants are often found on plasmids,  which has facilitated their study at the molecular level. Bacterial plasmids  conferring arsenic resistance encode specific efflux pumps able to extrude  arsenic from the cell cytoplasm thus lowering the intracellular concentration of   the toxic ions. In Gram-negative bacteria, the efflux pump consists of a  two-component ATPase complex. ArsA is the ATPase subunit and is associated with  an integral membrane subunit, ArsB. Arsenate is enzymatically reduced to arsenite  (the substrate of ArsB and the activator of ArsA) by the small cytoplasmic ArsC  polypeptide. In Gram-positive bacteria, comparable arsB and arsC genes (and  proteins) are found, but arsA is missing. In addition to the wide spread plasmid   arsenic resistance determinant, a few bacteria confer resistance to arsenite with  a separate determinant for enzymatic oxidation of more-toxic arsenite to  less-toxic arsenate. In contrast to the detailed information on the mechanisms of  arsenic resistance in bacteria, little work has been reported on this subject in   algae and fungi.
