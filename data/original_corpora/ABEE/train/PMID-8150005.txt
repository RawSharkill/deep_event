Cell surface hydrophobicity and adherence to extra-cellular matrix proteins in  two collections of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Non-specific and specific mechanisms of adherence have been examined in two  collections of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Determination   of hydrophobicity by salt aggregation, hydrophobicity indices and of adherence to  the extra-cellular matrix proteins fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin and collagen  type 1 have failed to reveal any correlation with phage-type, plasmid profile or   antibiogram. Further, the strain collections, made over a period of years in two   countries, differ markedly in their adherence characteristics; MRSA are  heterogeneous in this respect. Such heterogeneity may explain the polarization of  views on the epidemicity or 'virulence' of MRSA. With the exception of adherence   to collagen a small group of methicillin sensitive S. aureus had characteristics   intermediate between the two groups of MRSA.
