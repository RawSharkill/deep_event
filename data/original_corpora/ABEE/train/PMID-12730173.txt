Characterization of NorR protein, a multifunctional regulator of norA expression   in Staphylococcus aureus. 

We characterized a Staphylococcus aureus norA gene expression regulator, NorR,  initially identified from its binding to the norA promoter. The norR gene was 444  bp in length, located approximately 7 kb upstream from the norA gene, and encoded  a predicted 17.6-kDa protein. Overexpression of norR in wild-type S. aureus  strain ISP794 led to a fourfold decrease in sensitivity to quinolones and  ethidium bromide and an increase in the level of norA transcripts, suggesting  that NorR acts as a positive regulator of norA expression. Overexpression of norR  in sarA and agr mutants did not alter quinolone sensitivity or levels of norA  transcription, indicating that the presence of these two global regulatory  systems is necessary for NorR to affect the expression of norA. Insertion and  disruption of norR in ISP794 increased resistance to quinolones by 4- to 16-fold   but had no effect on norA transcription, suggesting that NorR acts as a repressor  for another unidentified efflux pump or pumps. These mutants also exhibited an  exaggerated clumping phenotype in liquid media, which was complemented fully by a  plasmid-encoded norR gene. Collectively, these results indicate that NorR is a  multifunctional regulator, affecting cell surface properties as well as the  expression of NorA and likely other multidrug resistance efflux pumps.
