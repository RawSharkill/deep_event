Horizontal transfer of the tetracycline resistance gene tetM mediated by pCF10  among Enterococcus faecalis in the house fly (Musca domestica L.) alimentary  canal. 

The house fly (Musca domestica L.) alimentary canal was evaluated for the  potential of horizontal transfer of tetM on plasmid pCF10 among Enterococcus  faecalis. Two sets of experiments were conducted: (1) house flies without surface  sterilization and (2) surface-sterilized flies. Both sets of flies were exposed  to E. faecalis OG1RF:pCF10 as donor for 12 h and then E. faecalis OG1SSp as  recipient for 1 h. Another group of flies received the recipient first for 12 h  followed by exposure to the donor strain for 1 h. House flies were screened daily  to determine the donor, recipient, and transconjugant bacterial load for up to 5   days. In addition, the sponge-like mouth parts used for food uptake (labellum) of  surface-sterilized house flies were removed and analyzed for donors, recipients,   and transconjugants, separately. In both groups of flies (n = 90 flies/group),  transfer occurred within 24 h after exposure with a transconjugant/donor rate  from 8.6 x 10(-5) to 4.5 x 10(1). Transconjugants were also isolated from the  house fly labellum. Our data suggest that the house fly digestive tract provides   a suitable environment for horizontal transfer of conjugative plasmids and  antibiotic resistance genes among enterococci. Our results emphasize the  importance of this insect as a potential vector of antibiotic-resistant bacterial  strains.
