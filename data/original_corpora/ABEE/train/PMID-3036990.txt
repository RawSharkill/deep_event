Glucan: mechanisms involved in its "radioprotective" effect.

It has generally been accepted that most biologically derived agents that are  radioprotective in the hemopoietic-syndrome dose range (eg, endotoxin, Bacillus  Calmette Guerin, Corynebacterium parvum, etc) exert their beneficial properties  by enhancing hemopoietic recovery and hence, by regenerating the host's ability  to resist life-threatening opportunistic infections. However, using glucan as a  hemopoietic stimulant/radioprotectant, we have demonstrated that host resistance   to opportunistic infection is enhanced in these mice even prior to the detection   of significant hemopoietic regeneration. This early enhanced resistance to  microbial invasion in glucan-treated irradiated mice could be correlated with  enhanced and/or prolonged macrophage (but not granulocyte) function. These  results suggest that early after irradiation glucan may mediate its  radioprotection by enhancing resistance to microbial invasion via mechanisms not   necessarily predicated on hemopoietic recovery. In addition, preliminary evidence  suggests that glucan can also function as an effective free-radical scavenger.  Because macrophages have been shown to selectively phagocytize and sequester  glucan, the possibility that these specific cells may be protected by virtue of  glucan's scavenging ability is also suggested.
