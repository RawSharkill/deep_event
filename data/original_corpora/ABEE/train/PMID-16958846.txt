Ubiquity and diversity of multidrug resistance genes in Lactococcus lactis  strains isolated between 1936 and 1995.

The presence and the nucleotide sequence of four multidrug resistance genes,  lmrA, lmrP, lmrC, and lmrD, were investigated in 13 strains of Lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis, four strains of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, two strains of  Lactococcus plantarum, and two strains of Lactococcus raffinolactis. Multidrug  resistance genes were present in all L. lactis isolates tested. However, none of   them could be detected in the strains belonging to the species L. raffinolactis  and L. plantarum, suggesting a different set of multidrug resistance genes in  these species. The analysis of the four deduced amino acid sequences established   two different variants depending on the subspecies of L. lactis. Either lmrA, or   lmrP, or both were found naturally disrupted in five strains, while full-length  lmrD was present in all strains.
