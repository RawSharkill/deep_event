Interactions of a small RNA with antibiotic and RNA ligands of the 30S subunit. 

It is now generally accepted that 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA play important roles   in the decoding and peptidyl transferase activities of ribosomes. Despite their  complex structures and numerous associated proteins it is possible that small  domains of these rRNAs can fold and function autonomously, particularly those  that appear devoid of protein interactions. One candidate for such a domain is  the decoding region, located near the 3' end of 16S rRNA (Fig. 1a, b). Consistent  with this hypothesis, aminoglycoside antibiotics that interact with the decoding   region in 30S subunits interact with other RNAs in the absence of proteins. In  addition, certain activities of self-splicing introns, at least superficially,  resemble translational decoding. We report here that an oligoribonucleotide  analogue of the decoding region interacts with both antibiotic and RNA ligands of  the 30S subunit in a manner that correlates with normal subunit function. The  activities of the decoding region analogue suggest that the intimidating  structural complexity of the ribosome can be, to some degree, circumvented.
