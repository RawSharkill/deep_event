Rare occurrence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus CC130 with a novel  mecA homologue in humans in Germany. 

MRSA CC130 containing the mecA homologue mecA(LGA251) were reported from the UK  and from Denmark so far from cattle and humans. Here we report on 11 MRSA CC130  among a sample of 12691 isolates of human origin collected from January 2006  until June 2011. MRSA CC130 grew insufficiently on chromogernic agar plates for  detection of MRSA; the agglutination test for presence of PBP2a was negative. We   designed primers for specific detection of mecA(LGA251) as well as for  concomitant detection of both, mec(LGA251) and mecA. As already described, the  isolates exhibited spa-types t843, t1736, and t1773. The ccrA homologue indicated  the presence SCCmec(XI). When subjected to further characterization by means of a  commercially available microarray the isolates were negative for sak chp, and  scn, and as expected positive for hla, untruncated hlb, and hld. They furthermore  contained edinB, aur, slpA, slpB, slpE. From genes coding for surface and cell  wall associated products the ica-operon, cap8, clfA, clfF, ebpS, fnbA, fnbB, sdrC  were detected but not cna. The isolates were negative for enterotoxin genes and  tst, as well as for eta, and etb; agr-type was III.
