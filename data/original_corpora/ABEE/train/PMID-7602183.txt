[Quinolone resistant mutations in Neisseria gonorrhoeae].

For 10 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae exhibiting decreased susceptibility to  new quinolones (MIC, > or = 0.1 microgram/ml) isolated and preserved from  patients with gonococcal urethritis during the period from February 1991 through   January 1992. We investigated the mechanisms for development of resistance to new  quinolones. After selecting 3 PCG sensitive and new quinolone resistant strains  from among these strains, we first carried out transformation experiments of N.  gonorrhoeae using a plasmid carrying the E. coli gyrA gene. We then determined  the base sequence on the N. gonorrhoeae gyrA gene by PCR method. Of the 3 strains  in which transformation experiments were carried out, 2 strains yielded  transformants, one of which was 8 times more sensitive to norfloxacin (NFLX) than  the original strain, and it was assumed that this strain has a mutation in the  gyrA gene. In our study of the base sequence on the N. gonorrhoeae gyrA gene  using the PCR method, both strains had the mutation of Ser 83 (TCC)-->Phe (TTC),   and in addition to this mutation of Ser-->Phe, one other strain had the mutation   of Asp-87 (GAC)-->Gly (GGC). This type of mutation of quinolone resistant N.  gonorrhoeae on the gyrA gene has high homology with the mutations reported for  Escherichia coli and other strains and there appears to be a close correlation  between the increasing frequency of use of the new quinolones in this country and  the spread of such resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae.
