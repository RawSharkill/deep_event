Expression of human glutathione S-transferases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  confers resistance to the anticancer drugs adriamycin and chlorambucil.

Adaptation and resistance to chemicals in the environment is a critical part of  the evolutionary process. As a result, a wide variety of defence systems that  protect cells against chemical insult have evolved. Such chemical resistance  mechanisms appear to play a central role in determining the sensitivity of human   tumours to treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. The glutathione S-transferases   (GST) are important detoxification enzymes whose over-expression has been  associated with drug-resistance. In order to evaluate this possibility we have  expressed the human Alpha-class and Pi-class GST cDNAs that encode GST B1B1 and  GST pi in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expression of GST B1B1 or GST  pi resulted in a marked reduction in the cytotoxic effects of chlorambucil, a  bifunctional alkylating agent, and an anthracycline, adriamycin. These data  provide direct evidence that the over-expression of GST in cells can confer  resistance to anticancer drugs.
