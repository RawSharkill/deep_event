Iron supplying systems of Salmonella in diagnostics, epidemiology and infection.

Well-known and newly characterised mechanisms, both endogenous and exogenous, for  the uptake of iron by Salmonella are outlined, and their possible roles at  various stages in infection are discussed. The contributions of a detailed  understanding of iron supplying systems to techniques for diagnosis, epidemiology  and disease management are described.
