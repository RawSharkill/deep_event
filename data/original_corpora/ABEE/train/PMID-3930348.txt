[Effect of sterol metabolism in the yeast-Drosophila system on the frequency of  radiation-induced aneuploidy in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes].

The influence of sterol metabolism upon mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster  was investigated using ecological-genetic yeast - drosophila system. Sterol  deficiency in the organism of Drosophila was caused by using the strain of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae 9-2P712 with a mutation in the nysr1 locus which blocks   synthesis of ergosterol as a nutrition substrate for flies. It was concluded that  maintenance of females on the mutant yeast strain causes an increase of  radiation-induced X-chromosome loss in mature oocytes. Resistance of oocytes to  X-ray irradiation is restored, reaching the control level, when 0,1% cholesterol   solution in 10% ethanol is added to the yeast biomass. The possible membrane and   hormonal mechanisms of elevation of induced aneuploidy and the role of sterol  metabolism in ensuring resistance of insects to damaging factors are discussed.
