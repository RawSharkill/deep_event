Nosocomial outbreak caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Livingstone producing   CTX-M-27 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a neonatal unit in Sousse, Tunisia. 

In this study, we report an outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Livingstone   resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins that occurred in a neonatal ward of  the maternity department of Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia, in 2002. A  total of 16 isolates were recovered from 16 babies hospitalized in the ward  during the period 1 to 16 July. All these babies developed diarrhea, and three of  them developed septicemia. All the isolates demonstrated resistance to  ceftriaxone and ceftazidime due to the production of an extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (ESBL). The isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides  (kanamycin, tobramycin, netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin) and  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. DNA profiles were determined by pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis using the XbaI and SpeI endonucleases and by ribotyping with PstI  digestion. They yielded the same patterns, showing that the outbreak was caused  by a single clone. The ESBL was identified as CTX-M-27 by sequencing of PCR  products and by isoelectric focusing. The ESBL resistance was transferred by a  40-kb conjugative plasmid. The mobile insertion sequence ISEcp1 was found to be  located upstream of bla(CTX-M-27) in the same position as that known for a  bla(CTX-M-14) sequence. A new gene named dfrA21, encoding resistance to  trimethoprim and carried by a 90-kb plasmid, was characterized. The dfrA21 gene  was inserted as a single resistance cassette in a class I integron. The babies  were treated with colistin, and all except two recovered. The outbreak came to an  end when appropriate actions were taken: patient isolation, hand washing, and  disinfection of the ward.
