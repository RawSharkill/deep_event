In34, a complex In5 family class 1 integron containing orf513 and dfrA10. 

A complex class 1 integron, In34, found in a conjugative plasmid from a  multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in 1997 at a hospital  in Sydney, Australia, was shown to have a backbone related to that of In2, which   belongs to the In5 family. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the aadB gene cassette replaces the aadA1a  cassette in In2, and two additional resistance genes, dfrA10 and aphA1, that are   not part of a gene cassette are present. The aphA1 gene is in a Tn4352-like  transposon that is located in the tniA gene. The dfrA10 gene lies adjacent to a  2,154-bp DNA segment, known as the common region, that contains an open reading  frame predicting a product of 513 amino acids (Orf513). Orf513 is 66 and 55%  identical to the products of two further open reading frames that, like the  common region, are found adjacent to antibiotic resistance genes. A 27-bp  conserved sequence was found at one end of each type of common region. The loss  of dfrA10 due to homologous recombination between flanking direct repeats and  incorporation of the excised circle by homologous recombination were  demonstrated. Part of In34 is identical to the sequenced portion of In7, which is  from a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain that had been isolated 19  years earlier in the same hospital. In34 and In7 are in plasmids that contain the  same six resistance genes conferring resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, tobramycin, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides, but   the plasmid backbones appear to be unrelated, suggesting that translocation of a   multiple-drug-resistance-determining region as well as horizontal transfer may  have occurred.
