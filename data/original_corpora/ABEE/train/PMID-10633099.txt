Expression of the multidrug resistance transporter NorA from Staphylococcus  aureus is modified by a two-component regulatory system. 

To dissect genetically the regulation of NorA, a multidrug transporter of  Staphylococcus aureus, we analyzed the differential expression of the norA  promoter using a transcriptional fusion with a beta-lactamase reporter gene.  Expression studies with an arlS mutant revealed that the norA promoter is ArlS  dependent. The arlR-arlS locus was shown to code for a two-component regulatory  system. The protein ArlR has strong similarity to response regulators, and ArlS  has strong similarity to protein histidine kinases. We have also analyzed the  350-bp region upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of norA by gel mobility  shift experiments. It was shown that only the 115-bp region upstream of the  promoter was necessary for multiple binding of an 18-kDa protein. From  transcriptional fusions, we have localized four different putative boxes of 6 bp,  which appear to play a role in the binding of the 18-kDa protein and in the  up-regulation of norA expression in the presence of the arlS mutation.  Furthermore, the gel mobility shift of the 18-kDa protein was modified in the  presence of the arlS mutation, and the arlS mutation altered the growth-phase  regulation of NorA. These results indicate that expression of norA is modified by  a two-component regulatory system.
