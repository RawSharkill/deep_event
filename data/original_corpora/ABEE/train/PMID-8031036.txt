Mechanisms of heteroresistance in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Characteristic for methicillin resistant (Mcr) staphylococci is the heterogeneous  expression of the intrinsic methicillin resistance. The majority of the cells  express resistance to low concentrations of methicillin, and a minority of the  cells express resistance to much higher concentrations. We show here (i) that the  presence of the mecA encoding region on plasmid pBBB79 was sufficient to render a  methicillin susceptible (Mcs) Staphylococcus aureus strain heteroresistant and  (ii) that this Mcr strain segregated highly resistant subclones which retained  the high-resistance phenotype under nonselective growth conditions. The Mcr  strain with only mecA on plasmid pBBB79 thus behaved identically to a Mcr strain   carrying the complete mec determinant integrated at its proper chromosomal site.   (iii) Curing a such highly resistant subclone from plasmid pBBB79 yielded an Mcs   strain that was as susceptible as the original Mcs parent strain. (iv)  Comparisons were made between the original parent and the cured Mcs strain by  backcrossing pBBB79 into them and looking at their progeny. Transductants derived  from the formerly highly resistant cured strain became resistant to high  concentrations of methicillin, whereas transductants derived from the original  parent strain were resistant to lower concentrations of methicillin and showed  the typical heterogeneous resistance. We deduced therefrom that the high-level  resistance expressed by the minority of the population of Mcr S. aureus was due  to a chromosomal mutation(s) (chr*) involving neither mecA nor the additional 30   kb of mec-associated DNA. Moreover, we could show that this postulated mutation  chr* was not linked to the femAB operon, which is known to affect methicillin  resistance levels.
