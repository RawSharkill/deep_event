Role of AxyZ Transcriptional Regulator in Overproduction of AxyXY-OprZ Multidrug   Efflux System in Achromobacter Species Mutants Selected by Tobramycin.

AxyXY-OprZ is an RND-type efflux system that confers innate aminoglycoside  resistance to Achromobacter spp. We investigated here a putative TetR family  transcriptional regulator encoded by the axyZ gene located upstream of axyXY-oprZ  An in-frame axyZ gene deletion assay led to increased MICs of antibiotic  substrates of the efflux system, including aminoglycosides, cefepime,  fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and erythromycin, indicating that the product of  axyZ negatively regulates expression of axyXY-oprZ Moreover, we identified an  amino acid substitution at position 29 of AxyZ (V29G) in a clinical Achromobacter  strain that occurred during the course of chronic respiratory tract colonization   in a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. This substitution, also detected in three  other strains exposed in vitro to tobramycin, led to an increase in the axyY  transcription level (5- to 17-fold) together with an increase in antibiotic  resistance level. This overproduction of AxyXY-OprZ is the first description of  antibiotic resistance acquisition due to modification of a chromosomally encoded   mechanism in Achromobacter and might have an impact on the management of infected  CF patients. Indeed, tobramycin is widely used for aerosol therapy within this  population, and we have demonstrated that it easily selects mutants with  increased MICs of not only aminoglycosides but also fluoroquinolones, cefepime,  and tetracyclines.
