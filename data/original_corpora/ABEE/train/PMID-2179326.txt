Effects of fluoride on the microbial ecology of dental plaque.

In order to survive in a community such as dental plaque, bacteria must be able  to resist changes in the environment. These changes may be the result of  differences in the host or the activities of the bacteria within the community.  Bacteria which cannot resist these environmental pressures may cease metabolism  but survive, or be eliminated from the community. Fluoride is only one of  numerous environmental pressures which impact on oral bacterial communities, yet   its beneficial effect on caries is such that it could be proposed that in  addition to its effects on enamel and remineralization, fluoride would affect the  bacteria. It has been shown on many occasions that fluoride can affect bacterial   carbohydrate fermentation; however, are there other effects of fluoride on the  bacteriology of dental plaque? Although very high levels of fluoride (0.16-0.3  mol/L) will kill bacteria, there is little evidence that fluoride causes dramatic  changes in the number of species found in plaque or their relative  concentrations. The survival of the populations in the plaque community in the  presence of fluoride could result from: (1) the fact that all the organisms are  unaffected, (2) selection of mutant strains resistant to fluoride, or (3)  adaptation of strains to fluoride resistance. Examples of these phenomena can be   found among members of the oral flora. Some species are unaffected (Veillonella),  but Streptococcus can be mutated to fluoride resistance and also adapt  phenotypically to increasing levels of fluoride in the environment. Which of  these mechanisms operates in vivo, and does resistance, mutation, or phenotypic  adaptation of these bacteria reduce the effectiveness of fluoride, in controlling  caries?(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
