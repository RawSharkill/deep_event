GolS controls the response to gold by the hierarchical induction of  Salmonella-specific genes that include a CBA efflux-coding operon. 

Salmonella employs a specific set of proteins that allows it to detect the  presence of gold salts in the environment and to mount the appropriate resistance  response. This includes a P-type ATPase, GolT, and a small cytoplasmic metal  binding protein, GolB. Their expression is controlled by a MerR-like sensor,  GolS, which is highly selective for Au ions. Here, we identify a new  GolS-controlled operon named gesABC which codes for a CBA efflux system, and  establish its role in Au resistance. GesABC can also mediate drug resistance when  induced by Au in a GolS-dependent manner, in a strain deleted in the main drug  transporter acrAB. The GolS-controlled transcription of gesABC differs from the  other GolS-regulated loci. It is activated by gold, but not induced by copper,  even in a strain deleted of the main Cu transporter gene copA, which triggers a  substantial GolS-dependent induction of golTS and golB. We demonstrate that the  Au-dependent induction of gesABC transcription requires higher GolS levels than  for the other members of the gol regulon. This correlates with a divergent GolS  operator in the gesABC promoter. We propose that the hierarchical induction  within the gol regulon allows Salmonella to cope with Au-contaminated  environments.
