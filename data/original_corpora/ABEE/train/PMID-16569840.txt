MepR, a repressor of the Staphylococcus aureus MATE family multidrug efflux pump   MepA, is a substrate-responsive regulatory protein. 

The mepRAB gene cluster of Staphylococcus aureus encodes a MarR family repressor   (MepR; known to repress mepA expression), a MATE family multidrug efflux pump  (MepA), and a protein of unknown function (MepB). In this report, we show that  MepR also is autoregulatory, repressing the expression of its own gene. Exposure   of strains containing a mepR::lacZ fusion with mepR provided in trans under the  control of an inducible promoter, or a mepA::lacZ fusion alone, to subinhibitory   concentrations of MepA substrates resulted in variably increased expression  mainly of mepA. Mobility shift assays revealed that MepR binds upstream of mepR  and mepA, with an apparently higher affinity for the mepA binding site. MepA  substrates abrogated MepR binding to each site in a differential manner, with the  greatest effect observed on the MepR-mepA operator interaction. DNase I  footprinting identified precise binding sites which included promoter motifs,  inverted repeats, and transcription start sites for mepR and mepA, as well as a  conserved GTTAG motif, which may be a signature recognition sequence for MepR.  Analogous to other multidrug efflux pump regulatory proteins such as QacR, the  substrate-MepR interaction likely results in its dissociation from its mepA, and   in a more limited fashion its mepR, operator sites and relief of its repressive  effect. The enhanced effect of substrates on mepA compared to mepR expression,  and on the MepR-mepA operator interaction, results in significant relief of mepA   and relative maintenance of mepR repression, leading to increased MepA protein  unimpeded by MepR when the need for detoxification exists.
