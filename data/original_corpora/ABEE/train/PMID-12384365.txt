Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases TUS-1 and MUS-1 from Myroides odoratus and  Myroides odoratimimus (formerly Flavobacterium odoratum), new members of the  lineage of molecular subclass B1 metalloenzymes. 

Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus (formerly designated in a single  species as Flavobacterium odoratum) are gram-negative aerobes and sources of  nosocomial infections in humans. They have variable susceptibility to  beta-lactams and a decreased susceptibility to carbapenems. Using genomic DNAs of  M. odoratus CIP 103105 and M. odoratimimus CIP 103073 reference strains, shotgun   cloning of beta-lactamase genes was performed, followed by protein expression in   Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of these beta-lactamase genes   revealed that TUS-1 and MUS-1 from M. odoratus CIP 103105 and M. odoratimimus CIP  103073, respectively, shared 73% amino acid identity. Mature proteins TUS-1 and  MUS-1, with pI values of 7.8 and 5.2, respectively, had relative molecular masses  of ca. 26 kDa. These beta-lactamases are members of the subclass B1 of  metallo-beta-lactamases and are distantly related to other metalloenzymes, being   most closely related to IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes (42% amino acid  identity). However, phylogenic analysis showed that TUS-1 and MUS-1 belong to the  same phylogenic lineage of subclass B1 enzymes that groups the subclass B1  beta-lactamases of Flavobacterium species. Kinetic parameters of purified  beta-lactamases TUS-1 and MUS-1 detailed their hydrolysis spectra, which  encompass most beta-lactams except aztreonam. beta-Lactamases TUS-1 and MUS-1  were classified in functional subgroup 3a of metalloenzymes. This work further  characterizes chromosome-encoded metalloenzymes from Flavobacteriaceae species  that explain at least part of their intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.
