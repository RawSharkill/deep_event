Cloning of an organic solvent resistance gene in Escherichia coli: the unexpected  role of alkylhydroperoxide reductase.

Although bacterial strain able to grow in the presence of organic solvents have  been isolated, little is known about the mechanism of their resistance. In the  present study, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), a solvent with potential  applications in industrial biocatalysis, was used to select a resistant mutant of  Escherichia coli. The resultant mutant strain was tested for resistance to a wide  range of solvents of varying hydrophobicities and was found to be resistant not  only to tetralin itself but also to cyclohexane, propylbenzene, and  1,2-dihydronaphthalene. A recombinant library from mutant DNA was used to clone  the resistance gene. The sequence of the cloned locus was determined and found to  match the sequence of the previously described alkylhydroperoxide reductase  operon ahpCF. The mutation was localized to a substitution of valine for glycine   at position 142 in the coding region of ahpC, which is the gene encoding the  catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The ahpC mutant was found to have an activity  that was three times that of the wild type in reducing tetralin hydroperoxide to   1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol. We conclude that the toxicity of such solvents as   tetralin is caused by the formation of toxic hydroperoxides in the cell. The ahpC  mutation increases the activity of the enzyme toward hydrophobic hydroperoxides,   thereby conferring resistance. The ahpC mutant was sensitive to the more  hydrophilic solvents xylene and toluene, suggesting that there are additional  mechanisms of solvent toxicity. Mutants resistant to a mixture of xylene and  tetralin were isolated from the ahpC mutant but not from the wild-type strain.
