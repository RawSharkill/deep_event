Pseudomonas aeruginosa SoxR does not conform to the archetypal paradigm for  SoxR-dependent regulation of the bacterial oxidative stress adaptive response.

SoxR is a transcriptional regulator that controls an oxidative stress response in  Escherichia coli. The regulator is primarily activated by superoxide  anion-dependent oxidation. Activated SoxR turns on transcription of a single  gene, soxS, which encodes a transcriptional regulator that activates a regulon  that includes dozens of oxidative stress response genes. SoxR homologues have  been identified in many bacterial species, including the opportunistic pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the expected SoxR partner, SoxS, has not been  found in P. aeruginosa. Thus, the primary gene target(s) of P. aeruginosa SoxR is  unknown and the involvement of this regulator in the oxidative stress response of  the bacterium remains unclear. We utilized transcriptome profiling to identify  the P. aeruginosa SoxR regulon and constructed and characterized an unmarked P.  aeruginosa DeltasoxR mutant. We provide evidence indicating that P. aeruginosa  SoxR activates a six-gene regulon in response to O(2)(.-)-induced stress. The  regulon includes three transcriptional units: (i) the recently identified  mexGHI-ompD four-gene operon, which encodes a multidrug efflux pump system  involved in quorum-sensing signal homeostasis; (ii) gene PA3718, encoding a  probable efflux pump; and (iii) gene PA2274, encoding a probable monooxygenase.  We also demonstrate that P. aeruginosa SoxR is not a key regulatory player in the  oxidative stress response. Finally, we show that P. aeruginosa SoxR is required  for virulence in a mouse model of intrapulmonary infection. These results  demonstrate that the E. coli-based SoxRS paradigm does not hold in P. aeruginosa   and foster new hypotheses for the possible physiological role of P. aeruginosa  SoxR.
