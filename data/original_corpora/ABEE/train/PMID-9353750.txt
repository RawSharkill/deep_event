The role of outer membrane in Serratia marcescens intrinsic resistance to  antibiotics. 

Three different porins from Serratia marcescens were described. They were named  Omp1, Omp2 and Omp3 and their molecular weights were 42, 40 and 39 kDa  respectively. Omp2 and Omp3 showed osmoregulation and thermoregulation in a  similar way to OmpC and OmpF of Escherichia coli. Permeability coefficients of  the outer membrane of this species were calculated following the Zimmermann and  Rosselet method. P values were similar to those obtained in Escherichia coli,  which suggests that the chromosomal beta-lactamase would play a major role in the  resistance of Serratia marcescens to beta-lactam antibiotics. Both MIC values and  permeabilities were modified by salycilates and acetylsalycilate. Synergism  between the outer membrane and the beta-lactamase was also evaluated. When  bacteria grew in the presence of a beta-lactam in the medium, the beta-lactamase   accounted for most of the resistance.
