A human transporter protein that mediates the final excretion step for toxic  organic cations. 

In mammals, toxic electrolytes of endogenous and exogenous origin are excreted  through the urine and bile. Before excretion, these compounds cross numerous  cellular membranes in a transporter-mediated manner. However, the protein  transporters involved in the final excretion step are poorly understood. Here, we  show that MATE1, a human and mouse orthologue of the multidrug and toxin  extrusion family conferring multidrug resistance on bacteria, is primarily  expressed in the kidney and liver, where it is localized to the luminal membranes  of the urinary tubules and bile canaliculi. When expressed in HEK293 cells, MATE1  mediates H(+)-coupled electroneutral exchange of tetraethylammonium and  1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Its substrate specificity is similar to those of  renal and hepatic H(+)-coupled organic cations (OCs) export. Thus, MATE1 appears   to be the long searched for polyspecific OC exporter that directly transports  toxic OCs into urine and bile.
