The SoxRS response of Escherichia coli is directly activated by redox-cycling  drugs rather than by superoxide.

When Escherichia coli is exposed to redox-cycling drugs, its SoxR transcription  factor is activated by oxidation of its [2Fe-2S] cluster. In aerobic cells these   drugs generate superoxide, and because superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a member of   the SoxRS regulon, superoxide was initially thought to be the activator of SoxR.   Its many-gene regulon was therefore believed to comprise a defence against  superoxide stress. However, we found that abundant superoxide did not effectively  activate SoxR in an SOD(-) mutant, that overproduced SOD could not suppress  activation by redox-cycling drugs, and that redox-cycling drugs were able to  activate SoxR in anaerobic cells as long as alternative respiratory acceptors  were provided. Thus superoxide is not the signal that SoxR senses. Indeed,  redox-cycling drugs directly oxidized the cluster of purified SoxR in vitro,  while superoxide did not. Redox-cycling drugs are excreted by both bacteria and  plants. Their toxicity does not require superoxide, as they poisoned E. coli  under anaerobic conditions, in part by oxidizing dehydratase iron-sulfur  clusters. Under these conditions SoxRS induction was protective. Thus it is  physiologically appropriate that the SoxR protein directly senses redox-cycling  drugs rather than superoxide.
