Detection of kanamycin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by identifying  mutations in the 16S rRNA gene. 

In Mycobacterium smegmatis and a limited number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  strains, the involvement of alterations of the 16S rRNA gene (rrs) in resistance   to kanamycin has been shown. To investigate the extent to which mutations in a  specific region of the rrs gene and the kanamycin resistant phenotype in  clinically isolated M. tuberculosis strains were correlated, 43  kanamycin resistant strains (MICs, > or =200 microg/ml), 71 kanamycin susceptible  strains, and 4 type strains were examined. The 300-bp DNA fragments carrying the   rrs gene and the intervening sequence between the rrs gene and 23S rRNA (rrl)  gene fragments were amplified by PCR and were subjected to PCR-based direct  sequencing. By comparing the nucleotide sequences, substitutions were found in 29  of 43 (67.4%) kanamycin resistant clinical isolates at positions 1400, 1401, and   1483 but in none of the 71 sensitive isolates or the 4 type strains. The most  frequent substitution, from A to G, occurred at position 1400. A substitution  from C to T at position 1401 was found once. Two clinical isolates carried the  double mutation from C to A at position 1401 and from G to T at position 1483. In  addition, we found that these mutants can be distinguished from wild-type strains  by digestion with the restriction endonucleases TaiI and Tsp45I. Furthermore, we   found that the genotypes of kanamycin resistant strains can be discriminated from  each other by digestion with a restriction endonuclease, BstUI or DdeI.
