[Studies on the mechanisms of resistance to trimethoprim in Salmonella  typhimurium].

The mechanisms of resistance to trimethoprim (TMP) in the clinical isolates of  Salmonella typhimurium were studied. The experimental results indicated that the   frequency of TMP resistance of 50 strains of Salmonella typhimurium was 76%.  Seven of the resistant strains were highly resistant to TMP and four of them  contained different plasmids which could transfer in the same species and between  different ones, and could be eliminated with 8% of SDS. The results of comparing   the activities and characteristics of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in crude  extracts from seven resistant strains and those from controls suggested that  overproduction of the chromosomal DHFR was the resistance mechanisms in three  plasmid-free strains and the levels of DHFR activity of the strains was increased  during prolonged exposure to TMP in vitro. However resistance to TMP of the  plasmid-containing strains resulted from production of plasmid-mediated TMP  resistant type Ia DHFR and a new type DHFR which has not been reported up to now.  The present work provided the theoretical basis for clinical use of TMP and  attempts to suppress development and spread of duge resistance of pathogenic  bacteria.
