Hexavalent chromium resistant bacteria isolated from river sediments.

Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a known carcinogen and mutagen; however, the  actual mechanisms of Cr toxicity are unknown. Two approaches were used to isolate  Cr(VI) resistant bacteria from metal-contaminated river sediments. Diluted  sediments were plated directly onto a peptone-yeast extract (PYE) medium  containing 0 to 100 micrograms of Cr(VI) ml-1. Approximately 8.4 x 10(5) CFU g-1   were recovered on 0 microgram of Cr(VI) ml-1, whereas 4.0 x 10(2) CFU g-1 were  recovered on PYE plus 100 micrograms of Cr(VI) ml-1. Alternatively, continuous  culture enrichment techniques were employed using PYE and 100 micrograms Cr(VI)  ml-1 input at dilution rates of 0.02 and 0.10 h-1. After six residence periods,  10(9) CFU were recovered on PYE agar containing 0 microgram of Cr(VI) ml-1 and  10(7) CFU on PYE agar plus 100 micrograms of Cr(VI) ml-1. Of 89 isolates obtained  by direct plating onto PYE, 47% were resistant to 100 micrograms of Cr(VI) ml-1,   and 29% were resistant to 250 micrograms of Cr(VI) ml-1. When the same isolates  were plated onto PYE containing Cr(III), 88% were resistant to 100 micrograms  ml-1 but only 2% were resistant to 250 micrograms ml-1. Cr, Co, Sb, and Zn were  found in significantly higher concentrations at an industry-related contaminated   site than at a site 11 km downstream. Total Cr in the sediments at the  contaminated site averaged 586 micrograms (dry weight) g-1, and the downstream  site averaged 71 micrograms (dry weight) g-1. The Cr recovered from acid-digested  Ottawa River sediment samples was predominantly hexavalent. Five acid digestion  procedures followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy were compared and found to   be 30 to 70% efficient for recovery of Cr relative to neutron activation  analysis. A population of aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria was recovered from  sediments containing elevated levels of Cr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
