Basis for lack of drug susceptibility of atypical mycobacteria.

The patterns of multiple-drug resistance of the nontuberculous mycobacteria as  judged from population analysis of recent isolates are described. In this article  the various possible mechanisms of drug resistance in these mycobacteria (high  frequencies of spontaneous mutation, drug-resistance factors, permeability, and  exclusion) are analysed in light of current evidence. Epidemiologic and  bacteriologic arguments are presented that appear to refute the hypothesis that  high frequency of spontaneous mutation and drug-resistance factors explain  multiple-drug resistance. Preliminary work suggesting that resistance in  nontuberculous mycobacteria may be caused by the failure of antibiotics to reach   the cytoplasmic membrane is discussed.
