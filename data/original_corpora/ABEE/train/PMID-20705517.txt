Emergence of a new antibiotic resistance mechanism in India, Pakistan, and the  UK: a molecular, biological, and epidemiological study. 

BACKGROUND: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to carbapenem  conferred by New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are potentially a major  global health problem. We investigated the prevalence of NDM-1, in  multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in India, Pakistan, and the UK. METHODS:  Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied from two major centres in India--Chennai  (south India), Haryana (north India)--and those referred to the UK's national  reference laboratory. Antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed, and the presence  of the carbapenem resistance gene bla(NDM-1) was established by PCR. Isolates  were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-restricted genomic DNA.  Plasmids were analysed by S1 nuclease digestion and PCR typing. Case data for UK   patients were reviewed for evidence of travel and recent admission to hospitals  in India or Pakistan. FINDINGS: We identified 44 isolates with NDM-1 in Chennai,   26 in Haryana, 37 in the UK, and 73 in other sites in India and Pakistan. NDM-1  was mostly found among Escherichia coli (36) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (111),  which were highly resistant to all antibiotics except to tigecycline and  colistin. K pneumoniae isolates from Haryana were clonal but NDM-1 producers from  the UK and Chennai were clonally diverse. Most isolates carried the NDM-1 gene on  plasmids: those from UK and Chennai were readily transferable whereas those from   Haryana were not conjugative. Many of the UK NDM-1 positive patients had  travelled to India or Pakistan within the past year, or had links with these  countries. INTERPRETATION: The potential of NDM-1 to be a worldwide public health  problem is great, and co-ordinated international surveillance is needed.
