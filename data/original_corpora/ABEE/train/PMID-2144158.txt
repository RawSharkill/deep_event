Genetic toxicology of tricyclic carboxamides, a new class of DNA binding  antitumour agent.

(N-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (acridine carboxamide; NSC  601316) is an acridine-derived experimental antitumour agent with curative  properties against Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. Although it intercalates into  DNA and also appears to interact with topoisomerase II, its DNA binding  properties appear distinct from other acridine derivatives such as the clinical  antitumour drug, amsacrine. The mutagenic properties of acridine carboxamide,  together with three related compounds containing either 9-aminoacridine or  phenazine chromophores, were studied at the 6-thioguanine and ouabain loci in  cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts. Each compound, when tested at  concentrations causing up to 90% kill, had weak but significant activity at the  6-thioguanine but not at the ouabain locus. All drugs were potent inducers of  micronuclei, indicating high clastogenic activity. There was a highly significant  relationship between mutation frequency (as resistance to 6-thioguanine) and  either cytotoxicity (measured as D37 in a clastogenicity assay) or  clastogenicity. A broader range of compounds was also tested for microbial  mutagenicity. In Salmonella typhimurium strains, none were mutagenic in TA98,  TA100 or TA102 but several were mutagenic in TA1537, a frameshift tester strain.   Some drugs also caused 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In  general, compounds with the phenazine chromophore, which has no positive charge,   were the most mutagenic in these systems. However, activity was not related to  mammalian mutagenicity or antitumour effect. The results suggest that in  mammalian cells, the cytotoxicity, clastogenicity and mutagenic activity of these  drugs are mediated by similar mechanisms to those for amsacrine analogues,  probably involving the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II.
