vanI: a novel D-Ala-D-Lac vancomycin resistance gene cluster found in  Desulfitobacterium hafniense. 

The glycopeptide vancomycin was until recently considered a drug of last resort  against Gram-positive bacteria. Increasing numbers of bacteria, however, are  found to carry genes that confer resistance to this antibiotic. So far, 10  different vancomycin resistance clusters have been described. A chromosomal  vancomycin resistance gene cluster was previously described for the anaerobic  Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y51. We demonstrate that this gene cluster,  characterized by its d-Ala-d-Lac ligase-encoding vanI gene, is present in all  strains of D. hafniense, D. chlororespirans and some strains of Desulfosporosinus  spp. This gene cluster was not found in vancomycin sensitive Desulfitobacterium  or Desulfosporosinus spp., and we show that this antibiotic resistance can be  exploited as an intrinsic selection marker for Desulfitobacterium hafniense and  D. chlororespirans. The gene cluster containing vanI is phylogenetically only  distantly related with those described from soil and gut bacteria, but clusters  instead with vancomycin resistance genes found within the phylum Actinobacteria  that include several vancomycin producing bacteria. It lacks a vanH homologue,  encoding a D-lactate dehydrogenase, previously thought to always be present  within vancomycin resistance gene clusters. The location of vanH outside the  resistance gene cluster likely hinders horizontal gene transfer. Hence, the  vancomycin resistance cluster in D. hafniense should be regarded a novel one that  we here designated vanI after its unique d-Ala-d-Lac ligase.
