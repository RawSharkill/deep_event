Resistance mechanisms of the bovine udder: new implications for mastitis control   at the teat end.

Investigations on bovine teat-end defenses and their role in mastitis control  were reviewed. Alteration of teat canal keratin by method of intramammary drug  infusion through the teat canal influenced the number of new infections. At the  beginning of the nonlactating period, 2 methods of administering antibiotic were   studied: full insertion of treatment syringe cannulas into teat cisterns and  expelling contents and partial insertion of cannulas into the distal 2 to 3 mm of  teat canals and slowly infusing contents. Partial cannula insertion reduced new  infections by 50% and is an easily adopted management tool to reduce prevalence  of mastitis. Intramammary devices used during lactation and the nonlactating  period increased leukocyte concentrations in mammary secretions. An abraded  polyethylene coil device reduced clinical mastitis and increased milk yield.  Staphylococci colonize teat canal keratin and lacteal secretions of dairy heifers  as early as 9 months of age, leading to intramammary infection at time of calving  and persisting into lactation. Subsequent somatic cell counts are associated with  milk production losses. Previously, such infections were shown to be associated  only with older, mature animals.
