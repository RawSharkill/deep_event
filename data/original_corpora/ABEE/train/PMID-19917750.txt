VIM-19, a metallo-beta-lactamase with increased carbapenemase activity from  Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 

Two carbapenem resistant isolates, one Escherichia coli isolate and one  Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, recovered from an Algerian patient expressed a  novel VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). The identified bla(VIM-19) gene was   located on a ca. 160-kb plasmid and located inside a class 1 integron in both  isolates. VIM-19 differed from VIM-1 by the Asn215Lys and Ser228Arg  substitutions, increasing its hydrolytic activity toward carbapenems.  Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that both substitutions were  necessary for the increased carbapenemase activity of VIM-19. This study  indicates that MBLs with enhanced activity toward carbapenems may be obtained as   a result of very few amino acid substitutions.
