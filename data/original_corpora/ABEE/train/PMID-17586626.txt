Assembly of the MexAB-OprM multidrug pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: component  interactions defined by the study of pump mutant suppressors. 

In an effort to identify key domains of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MexAB-OprM  drug efflux system involved in component interactions, extragenic suppressors of   various inactivating mutations in individual pump constituents were isolated and   studied. The multidrug hypersusceptibility of P. aeruginosa expressing MexB with   a mutation in a region of the protein implicated in oligomerization (G220S) was  suppressed by mutations in the alpha/beta domain of MexA. MexB(G220S) showed a  reduced ability to bind MexA in vivo while representative MexA suppressors (V66M   and V259F) restored the MexA-MexB interaction. Interestingly, these suppressors  also restored resistance in P. aeruginosa expressing OprM proteins with mutations  at the proximal (periplasmic) tip of OprM that is predicted to interact with  MexB, suggesting that these suppressors generally overcame defects in MexA-MexB  and MexB-OprM interaction. The multidrug hypersusceptibility arising from a  mutation in the helical hairpin of MexA implicated in OprM interaction (V129M)  was suppressed by mutations (T198I and F439I) in the periplasmic alpha-helical  barrel of OprM. Again, the MexA mutation compromised an in vivo interaction with   OprM that was restored by the T198I and F439I substitutions in OprM, consistent  with the hairpin domain mediating MexA binding to this region of OprM.  Interestingly, these OprM suppressor mutations restored multidrug resistance in  P. aeruginosa expressing MexB(G220S). Finally, the oprM(T198I) suppressor  mutation enhanced the yields of all three constituents of a MexA-MexB-OprM(T198I)  pump as detected in whole-cell extracts. These data highlight the importance of  MexA and interactions with this adapter in promoting MexAB-OprM pump assembly and  in stabilizing the pump complex.
