MUS-2, a novel variant of the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase MUS-1, from  Myroides odoratimimus. 

The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of  carbapenem resistance of three imipenem resistant isolates of Myroides  odoratimimus recovered from two livestock farms of cows and pigeons by rectal  swab in Lebanon in January 2014. Investigation of imipenem resistance of these  isolates using the modified Hodge test, the EDTA test, the modified CarbaNP test   and the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass  spectrometry Ultraflex assay showed a carbapenemase activity due to the presence   of a chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase MUS, verified by PCR. However  amplification and sequencing of this chromosomal gene showed a novel variant of  it designated MUS-2 by the curators of the Lahey database of beta-lactamases  (http://www.lahey.org/Studies/webt.asp). Cloning of the bla MUS-2 was performed,   followed by protein expression in Escherichia coli TOP 10. Pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis clearly showed that the three isolates belonged to the same  clone. This study reports a novel variant of the chromosome-encoded bla MUS-1  associated with carbapenem resistance in Myroides odoratimimus and shows that  animals may represent a reservoir of bacteria harbouring several variants of  resistance genes.
