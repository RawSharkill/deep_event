NDM-2 carbapenemase in Acinetobacter baumannii from Egypt. 

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance in  one Acinetobacter baumannii isolate recovered from a patient transferred to  Germany from an Egyptian hospital. METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to  search for beta-lactamase and 16S RNA methylase genes. Multilocus sequence typing  was used to determine the sequence type (ST) of the isolate. RESULTS: Sequencing   of the PCR product obtained using primers for bla(NDM-1) revealed a variant of  NDM-1 that had a C to G substitution at position 82 resulting in an amino acid  substitution of proline to alanine at position 28. This variant was designated  NDM-2. Genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or 16S RNA methylase were  not detected. The strain lacked detectable plasmids and bla(NDM-2) was not  transferred by conjugation. MLST showed that the isolate belonged to a new ST,  ST103. CONCLUSIONS: This work further underlines the spread of NDM carbapenemases  in A. baumannii, and the spread of the corresponding gene in the Middle East. It   also describes the first variant of NDM-1.
