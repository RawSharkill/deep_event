Genetic and physiological aspects of resistance to 5-fluoropyrimidines in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mutants resistant to 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorocytosine, and 5-fluorouridine were  selected in yeast, and the mechanisms of their resistance were investigated. The   investigated mutations map in seven different loci. (i) A mutation at the locus  FUI 1 gives specifically resistance to 5-fluorouridine. (ii) Two loci are  involved in a specific 5-fluorocytosine resistance: a mutation at locus FCY 1  produces a loss of cytosine deaminase activity; a mutation at locus FCY 2 results  in the loss of the activity of a cytosine-specific permease. (iii) A mutation at   the locus FUR 4 gives a simultaneous resistance to 5-fluorouracil and to  5-fluorouridine by loss in the activity of the uracil-specific permease. (iv) We   found three types of mutants in the locus FUR 1. One is dominant and weakly  resistant to 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorocytosine, and 5-fluorouridine. The two  others are recessive and are unable to catalyze one of the steps involved in  uracil transformation into uridine 5'-monophosphate; this block-age explains  their strong resistance to 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorocytosine. Of these two  mutants, one is resistant to 5-fluorouridine and the other is not. (v) Mutations   at locus FUR 2 give resistance to 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorocytosine, and  5-fluorouridine. These mutations are dominant and lead to a loss in the feedback   regulation of the aspartic transcarbamylase activity by uridine triphosphate.  (vi) The mutants FUR 3 are resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and 5-fluorouridine.  They are dominant and physiologically related to the mutants of the locus FUR 1  but their mechanism of resistance is not understood.
