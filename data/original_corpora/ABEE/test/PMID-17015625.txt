Functional analysis of DNA gyrase mutant enzymes carrying mutations at position  88 in the A subunit found in clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  resistant to fluoroquinolones. 

We investigated the enzymatic efficiency and inhibition by quinolones of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrases carrying the previously described GyrA  G88C mutation and the novel GyrA G88A mutation harbored by two  multidrug-resistant clinical strains and reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis.  Fluoroquinolone MICs and 50% inhibitory concentrations for both mutants were 2-  to 43-fold higher than for the wild type, demonstrating that these mutations  confer fluoroquinolone resistance in M. tuberculosis.
