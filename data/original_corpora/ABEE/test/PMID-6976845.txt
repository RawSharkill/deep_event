The nature of malathion resistance in a population of Anopheles culicifacies  Giles.

Malathion resistance in a population of Anopheles culicifacies from Maharashtra  State in India, which also showed resistance to a number of other  organophosphorus compounds, was found to be dominant in its expression. Most of  the crossing and back-crossing results involving a susceptible population of the   same species from Sri Lanka indicated the possible involvement of more than one  genetic factor. The existence of such a broad spectrum of resistance, and  experiments involving the use of the synergists triphenyl phosphate and piperonyl  butoxide both suggest the presence of at least two mechanisms, one involving the   specific carboxylesterase and the other the less specific mixed-function oxidase   system.
