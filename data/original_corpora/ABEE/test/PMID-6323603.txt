Immunotoxic effects of diethylstilbestrol on host resistance: comparison with  cyclophosphamide.

To evaluate the usefulness of host resistance assays for measurement of  immunotoxicologic effects of chemicals, the immunosuppressive effects of exposure  to diethylstilbestrol (DES) were compared with the effects of treatment with the   known immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide (CPS). A panel of six host  resistance models was evaluated, including infection with the bacterium Listeria   monocytogenes, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and encephalomyocarditis  virus (EMC), the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, the parasite Naegleria fowleri,  and transplantation of the B16F10 melanoma tumor. The results demonstrate a  general correlation between the effects of CPS and DES on host resistance. Acute   treatment with CPS (200 mg/kg) markedly depressed resistance to the microbial  infections with L. monocytogenes and HSV, and exposure to DES usually also  decreased resistance in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, CPS had no marked  effect on resistance to N. fowleri and EMC virus, and exposure to DES also had a   neglible or slight effect. There were, however, two model systems in which the  effects of CPS and DES diverged. Whereas treatment with DES produced no  significant effect on resistance to C. neoformans, acute treatment with CPS prior  to the fungal infection produced a marked increase in resistance. Also, while  treatment with CPS markedly increased B16F10 lung metastases, treatment with DES   significantly decreased the incidence and number of lung metastases. The data  support the general validity of host resistance assays, particularly with models   of short disease course, for measuring immunosuppression. However, the results  also emphasize the complexity of interpreting effects of environmental chemicals   on host resistance, because of the interplay of such factors as relative times of  exposure to the chemical in relation to pathogenesis of infection, the length of   the disease course, the nature of the operative host defense mechanisms, and the   compensatory recovery of these mechanisms.
