Expression, detergent solubilization, and purification of a membrane transporter,  the MexB multidrug resistance protein. 

Multidrug resistance (MDR), the ability of a cancer cell or pathogen to be  resistant to a wide range of structurally and functionally unrelated anti-cancer   drugs or antibiotics, is a current serious problem in public health. This  multidrug resistance is largely due to energy-dependent drug efflux pumps. The  pumps expel anti-cancer drugs or antibiotics into the external medium, lowering  their intracellular concentration below a toxic threshold. We are studying  multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial  pathogen that causes infections in patients with many types of injuries or  illness, for example, burns or cystic fibrosis, and also in immuno-compromised  cancer, dialysis, and transplantation patients. The major MDR efflux pumps in P.   aeruginosa are tripartite complexes comprised of an inner membrane proton-drug  antiporter (RND), an outer membrane channel (OMF), and a periplasmic linker  protein (MFP). The RND and OMF proteins are transmembrane proteins. Transmembrane  proteins make up more than 30% of all proteins and are 65% of current drug  targets. The hydrophobic transmembrane domains make the proteins insoluble in  aqueous buffer. Before a transmembrane protein can be purified, it is necessary  to find buffer conditions containing a mild detergent that enable the protein to   be solubilized as a protein detergent complex (PDC). In this example, we use an  RND protein, the P. aeruginosa MexB transmembrane transporter, to demonstrate how  to express a recombinant form of a transmembrane protein, solubilize it using  detergents, and then purify the protein detergent complexes. This general method   can be applied to the expression, purification, and solubilization of many other   recombinantly expressed membrane proteins. The protein detergent complexes can  later be used for biochemical or biophysical characterization including X-ray  crystal structure determination or crosslinking studies.
