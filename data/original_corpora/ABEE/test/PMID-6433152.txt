Physical structure and genetic expression of the sulfonamide resistance plasmid  pLS80 and its derivatives in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis.

The 10-kb chromosomal fragment of Streptococcus pneumoniae cloned in pLS80  contains the sul-d allele of the pneumococcal gene for dihydropteroate synthase.   As a single copy in the chromosome this allele confers resistance to  sulfanilamide at 0.2 mg/ml; in the multicopy plasmid it confers resistance to 2.0  mg/ml. The sul-d mutation was mapped by restriction analysis to a 0.4-kb region.   By the mechanism of chromosomal facilitation, in which the chromosome restores  information to an entering plasmid fragment, a BamHI fragment missing the sul-d  region of pLS80 established the full-sized plasmid, but with the sul-s allele of   the recipient chromosome. A spontaneous deletion beginning approximately 1.5 kb  to the right of the sul-d mutation prevented gene function, possibly by removing   a promoter. This region could be restored by chromosomal facilitation and be  demonstrated in the plasmid by selection for sulfonamide resistance. Under  selection for a vector marker, tetracycline resistance, only the deleted plasmid   was detectable, apparently as a result of plasmid segregation and the  advantageous growth rates of cells with smaller plasmids. When such cells were  selected for sulfonamide resistance, the deleted region returned to the plasmid,   presumably by equilibration between the chromosome and the plasmid pool, to give   a low frequency (approximately 10(-3) of cells resistant to sulfanilamide at 2.0   mg/ml. Models for the mechanisms of chromosomal facilitation and equilibration  are proposed. Several derivatives of pLS80 could be transferred to Bacillus  subtilis, where they conferred resistance to sulfanilamide at 2 mg/ml, thereby  demonstrating cross-species expression of the pneumococcal gene.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
