[A statistical model for interpreting the antibiogram].

Up to now, to interpret antibiotic susceptibility tests, the common practice has   been to use: first, breakpoints without any quantitative justification, secondly,  concordance curves between the different measurement techniques; these are not  well adapted to the heterogeneous character of bacterial populations. We hereby  propose another method: it is based on a global data analysis for each bacterial   species, each antibiotic family and each measurement technique. So, we have drawn  up a new model for the interpretation, both global and data-processed; it is  based on qualifying classes, which are obtained and interpreted by hierarchical  ascendent classification, principal components analysis, and comparison with  pharmacological data. It can be used by any biologist. What is more, justified  breakpoints with a numerical risk and quality control are defined. There are also  some additional uses: evaluation of the effect of new antibiotics,  standardization of new measurement techniques, detection of the emergence of new   bacterial resistance in patients, guidance for research into unknown resistance  mechanisms and characters.
