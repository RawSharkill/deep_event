Structural and free energy landscape of novel mutations in ribosomal protein S1  (rpsA) associated with pyrazinamide resistance. 

Resistance to key first-line drugs is a major hurdle to achieve the global end  tuberculosis (TB) targets. A prodrug, pyrazinamide (PZA) is the only drug,  effective in latent TB, recommended in drug resistance and susceptible  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. The prodrug conversion into active  form, pyrazinoic acid (POA), required the activity of pncA gene encoded  pyrazinamidase (PZase). Although pncA mutations have been commonly associated  with PZA resistance but a small number of resistance cases have been associated  with mutationss in RpsA protein. Here in this study a total of 69 PZA resistance   isolates have been sequenced for pncA mutations. However, samples that were found  PZA resistant but pncA wild type (pncA(WT)), have been sequenced for rpsA and  panD genes mutation. We repeated a drug susceptibility testing according to the  WHO guidelines on 18 pncA(WT) MTB isolates. The rpsA and panD genes were  sequenced. Out of total 69 PZA resistant isolates, 51 harbored 36 mutations in  pncA gene (GeneBank Accession No. MH46111) while, fifteen different mutations  including seven novel, were detected in the fourth S1 domain of RpsA known as  C-terminal (MtRpsA(CTD)) end. We did not detect any mutations in panD gene. Among  the rpsA mutations, we investigated the molecular mechanism of resistance behind   mutations, D342N, D343N, A344P, and I351F, present in the MtRpsA(CTD) through  molecular dynamic simulations (MD). WT showed a good drug binding affinity as  compared to mutants (MTs), D342N, D343N, A344P, and I351F. Binding pocket volume,  stability, and fluctuations have been altered whereas the total energy, protein  folding, and geometric shape analysis further explored a significant variation  between WT and MTs. In conclusion, mutations in MtRpsA(CTD) might be involved to   alter the RpsA activity, resulting in drug resistance. Such molecular mechanism  behind resistance may provide a better insight into the resistance mechanism to  achieve the global TB control targets.
