Resistance to beta-Lactams in Neisseria ssp Due to Chromosomally Encoded  Penicillin Binding Proteins. 

Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are human pathogens that cause a  variety of life-threatening systemic and local infections, such as meningitis or   gonorrhoea. The treatment of such infection is becoming more difficult due to  antibiotic resistance. The focus of this review is on the mechanism of reduced  susceptibility to penicillin and other beta-lactams due to the modification of  chromosomally encoded penicillin binding proteins (PBP), in particular PBP2  encoded by the penA gene. The variety of penA alleles and resulting variant PBP2   enzymes is described and the important amino acid substitutions are presented and  discussed in a structural context.
