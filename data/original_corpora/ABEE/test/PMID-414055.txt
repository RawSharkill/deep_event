[Lysis from without of a culture of Actinomyces griseus--producer of the  antibiotic kormogrizein].

A polylysogenic culture of Actinomyces griseus 15 producing the antibiotic  cormogrisin is sensitive to actinophages, denoted as types 15 I, 15 II and 15  III, which are the virulent mutants of its temperate phages. In certain cases,  the variants of Act. griseus 15, obtained by selection and resistant to the  phages types 15 I and 15 II, can undergo lysis-from-without by these phages. A  study of the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon has shown that the lytic  activity is entirely eliminated if the phages have been a titre of 10(9) and  higher. The lytic activity is entirely eliminated if the phages have been treated  with a specific serum or inactivated by UV. The variants resistant to phage 15 I   can adsorb this phage and undergo lysis-from-without at a high multiplicity of  infection if only the age of the variant does not exceed 13 hours. The variants  resistant to phages 15 I and 15 II can undergo lysis-from-within under the action  of phage 15 III. The variants resistant to this phage have acquired this  resistance as a result of lysogenization. They have entirely retained the ability  to adsorb phage 15 I, but their ability to absorb phage 15 III is much lower.  Therefore, the rate of mycelium growth is only slightly inhibited, but the lysis   of the culture is not observed, under the action of phage 15 III having titres of  10(9) and 10(10).
