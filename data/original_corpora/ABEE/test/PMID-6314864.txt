Gene transfer mechanisms among members of the genus Rhodopseudomonas.

Recent studies on species of the genus Rhodopseudomonas, particularly R,  capsulata and R. sphaeroides, have resulted in the development of a range of  systems of genetic exchange without peer among the photosynthetic prokaryotes. In  R. capsulata, systems of generalized transduction and R-prime formation have  provided a detailed map of the arrangement of photosynthesis genes, while systems  of conjugation and chromosome transfer in R, sphaeroides have provided a map of  the location of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance   and photosynthesis. A recent report of plasmid transformation in R. sphaeroides  provides another important avenue for the analysis of genes such as those  involved in photosynthesis and photochemical nitrogen fixation, through the  application of DNA cloning technology. That plasmid transformation, generalized  and specialized transduction, conjugation, chromosome transfer and R-prime  formation do occur in Rhodopseudomonas indicates the rapid emergence of genetic  and molecular biological techniques applicable to studies of these bacteria.
