Molecular cloning and characterization of Tap, a putative multidrug efflux pump  present in Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 

A recombinant plasmid isolated from a Mycobacterium fortuitum genomic library by   selection for gentamicin and 2-N'-ethylnetilmicin resistance conferred low-level   aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance when introduced into M. smegmatis.  Further characterization of this plasmid allowed the identification of the M.  fortuitum tap gene. A homologous gene in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome has  been identified. The M. tuberculosis tap gene (Rv1258 in the annotated sequence  of the M. tuberculosis genome) was cloned and conferred low-level resistance to  tetracycline when introduced into M. smegmatis. The sequences of the putative Tap  proteins showed 20 to 30% amino acid identity to membrane efflux pumps of the  major facilitator superfamily (MFS), mainly tetracycline and macrolide efflux  pumps, and to other proteins of unknown function but with similar antibiotic  resistance patterns. Approximately 12 transmembrane regions and different  sequence motifs characteristic of the MFS proteins also were detected. In the  presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), the  levels of resistance to antibiotics conferred by plasmids containing the tap  genes were decreased. When tetracycline accumulation experiments were carried out  with the M. fortuitum tap gene, the level of tetracycline accumulation was lower   than that in control cells but was independent of the presence of CCCP. We  conclude that the Tap proteins of the opportunistic organism M. fortuitum and the  important pathogen M. tuberculosis are probably proton-dependent efflux pumps,  although we cannot exclude the possibility that they act as regulatory proteins.
