Genetic analysis of mobile tetQ elements in oral Prevotella species. 

Prevotella species are members of the bacterial oral flora and are opportunistic   pathogens in polymicrobial infections of soft tissues. Antibiotic resistance to  tetracyclines is common in these bacteria, and the gene encoding this resistance   has been previously identified as tetQ. The tetQ gene is also found on  conjugative transposons in the intestinal Bacteroides species; whether these  related bacteria have transmitted tetQ to Prevotella is unknown. In this study,  we describe our genetic analysis of mobile tetQ elements in oral Prevotella  species. Our results indicate that the mobile elements encoding tetQ in oral  species are distinct from those found in the Bacteroides. The intestinal bacteria  may act as a reservoir for the tetQ gene, but Prevotella has incorporated this  gene into an IS21-family transposon. This transposon is present in Prevotella  species from more than one geographical location, implying that the mechanism of   tetQ spread between oral Prevotella species is highly conserved.
