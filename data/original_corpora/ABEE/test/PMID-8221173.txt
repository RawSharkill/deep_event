[Microbiology of nosocomial infections].

The microorganisms causing nosocomial infections belong either to the patient  himself (endogenous infections) or to hospital flora. New epidemiological tools,   using molecular technologies, have renewed the body of knowledge on this flora.  The commonest pathogens producing nosocomial infections include coagulase  positive or negative staphylococci, enterococci, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas   and candida. A recent trend has been shown, indicating the emergence of Gram  positive cocci and fungi, when E. coli and Klebsiella tend to decrease. Bacterial  resistance to antimicrobials is a growing concern, with the appearance of new  resistance mechanisms such as broad-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram negative  rods, vancomycin resistance in several Gram positive species, or multiply  resistance in enterococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas or mycobacteria. Some  pathogens create new concerns nowadays, such as M. tuberculosis, M. avium  intracellulare, Gram positive bacilli (exemplified by Corynebacterium JK), water   bacteria, non-albicans Candida and other fungi. Increasing therapeutic challenge   underlines the prominent role of infection control programs.
