Prevalence of gyrA Mutations in Nalidixic Acid-Resistant Strains of Salmonella  Enteritidis Isolated from Humans, Food, Chickens, and the Farm Environment in  Brazil. 

Salmonella Enteritidis strains that are resistant to nalidixic acid and exhibit  reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones have been increasing worldwide. In  Brazil, few studies have been conducted to elucidate the quinolone resistance  mechanisms of S. Enteritidis strains. This study analyzed the profile of gyrA,  gyrB, parC, and parE mutations and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR)  mechanisms in S. Enteritidis Nal(R) strains isolated in Brazil. Moreover, the  minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin were evaluated in 84  Nal(R) strains and compared with 20 Nal(S) strains. The mutation profiles of the   gyrA gene were accessed by high-resolution melting analysis and gyrB, parC, and  parE by quinolone resistance-determining region sequencing. The MICs of  ciprofloxacin were accessed with Etest((R)). The strains were divided into five  gyrA melting profiles. The Nal(R) strains exhibited the following amino acid  substitutions: Ser97-->Pro, Ser83-->Phe, Asp87-->Asn, or Asp87-->Tyr. The average  MICs of ciprofloxacin was 0.006 mug/ml in the Nal(S) and 0.09 mug/ml in the  Nal(R) strains. No points of mutation were observed in the genes gyrB, parC, and   parE. The qnrB gene was found in two strains. In conclusion, the reduced  susceptibility to ciprofloxacin observed in Nal(R) strains may cause treatment  failures once this drug is commonly used to treat Salmonella infections.  Moreover, this reduced susceptibility in these Brazilian strains was provided by   target alteration of gene gyrA and not by mobile elements, such as resistance  plasmids.
