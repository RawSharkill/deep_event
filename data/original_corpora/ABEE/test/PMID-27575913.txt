Emergence of Multidrug-Resistant New Delhi Metallo-beta-Lactamase-1-Producing  Klebsiella pneumoniae in Egypt. 

Despite expansion of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) worldwide,  the incident of outbreaks regarding Egypt is still uncommon. In this survey, we  denounce the emanation of multidrug-resistant NDM-1-producing Klebsiella  pneumoniae in Egypt. We have reclaimed 46 unrepeatable carbapenem resistant K.  pneumoniae isolates at El-demerdash hospital, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.  All the isolates showed a decreased sensitivity to imipenem and meropenem via the  disc diffusion method. Among the isolates, 10 were proven as NDM-1 producers by  utilizing the phenotypic methods (modified Hodge test and EDTA synergistic test)   and specific PCR detection of NDM-1 encoding gene, blaNDM-1. The isolates hosting  the blaNDM-1 showed an elevated resistance to several classes of beta-lactam and   non beta-lactam antibiotics. All blaNDM-1-harboring isolates have showed  positivity for one or more other plasmid-mediated bla genes; in addition, the  isolates carried class 1 integron. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic  consensus (ERIC)-PCR results revealed that majority of the isolates, including  the NDM-1 producers, are unrelated to each other. This highlights the danger of  horizontal transfer of plasmids encoding for such carbapenemases, including  NDM-1, between the isolates of K. pneumoniae. In summary, this study has  confirmed the incidence of blaNDM-1 together with other bla genes among the K.  pneumoniae isolates in Egypt. Control and prevention of infection can be achieved  through early detection of resistance genes among bacterial isolates; through  limiting the dispersal of these organisms.
