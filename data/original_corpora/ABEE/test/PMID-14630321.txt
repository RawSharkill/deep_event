TolC--the bacterial exit duct for proteins and drugs. 

The TolC structure has unveiled a common mechanism for the movement of molecules,  large and small, from the bacterial cell cytosol, across two membranes and the  intervening periplasm, into the environment. Trimeric TolC is a remarkable cell  exit duct that differs radically from other membrane proteins, comprising a 100-A  long alpha-barrel that projects across the periplasmic space, anchored by a 40-A   long beta-barrel spanning the outer membrane. The periplasmic entrance of TolC is  closed until recruitment by substrate-specific translocases in the inner membrane  triggers its transition to the open state, achieved by an iris-like 'untwisting'   of the tunnel alpha-helices. TolC-dependent machineries present ubiquitous exit  routes for virulence proteins and antibacterial drugs, and their conserved  structure, specifically the electronegative TolC entrance constriction, may  present a target for inhibitors of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
