Inhibition of Bacillus anthracis metallo-beta-lactamase by compounds with  hydroxamic acid functionality. 

Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) that catalyze hydrolysis of beta-lactam  antibiotics are an emerging threat due to their rapid spread. A strain of the  bacterium Bacillus anthracis has its ability to produce and secrete a MBL,  referred to Bla2. To address this challenge, novel hydroxamic acid-containing  compounds such as 3-(heptyloxy)-N-hydroxybenzamide (compound 4) and  N-hydroxy-3-((6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl)oxy)benzamide (compound 7) were  synthesized. Kinetic analysis of microbial inhibition indicated that the both  sides of hydroxamic acids containing compound 7 revealed a reversible,  competitive inhibition with a Ki value of 0.18 +/- 0.06 muM. The result has  reflected that the both sides of dihydroxamic acids in a molecule play a crucial   role in the binding affinity rather than monohydroxamic containing compound 4  which was unable to inhibit Bla2. In addition, in silico analysis suggested that   compound 7 was coordinated with a zinc ion in the active site of enzyme. These  observations suggest that the dihydroxamic acid-containing compound may be a  promising drug candidate, and a further implication for designing new inhibitors   of Bla2.
