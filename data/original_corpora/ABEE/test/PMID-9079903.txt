Mutations affecting substrate specificity of the Bacillus subtilis multidrug  transporter Bmr. 

The Bacillus subtilis multidrug transporter Bmr, a member of the major  facilitator superfamily of transporters, causes the efflux of a number of  structurally unrelated toxic compounds from cells. We have shown previously that   the activity of Bmr can be inhibited by the plant alkaloid reserpine. Here we  demonstrate that various substitutions of residues Phe143 and Phe306 of Bmr not  only reduce its sensitivity to reserpine inhibition but also significantly change  its substrate specificity. Cross-resistance profiles of bacteria expressing  mutant forms of the transporter differ from each other and from the  cross-resistance profile of cells expressing wild-type Bmr. This result strongly   suggests that Bmr interacts with its transported drugs directly, with residues  Phe143 and Phe306 likely to be involved in substrate recognition.
