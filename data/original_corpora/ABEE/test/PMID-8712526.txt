Mechanisms of acid injury in porcine gastroesophageal mucosa.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the cause and mechanisms of injury in gastroesophageal  ulcer disease in market weight swine. DESIGN: Comparison of mechanisms of injury   caused by HCI with those caused by short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in gastric  mucosa. ANIMALS: Pigs weighing 30 to 40 kg. PROCEDURE: Gastric tissues were  studied in Ussing chambers; short-circuit current (lsc) and electrical resistance  (R) were recorded in response to treatment, and tissues were examined  histologically. RESULTS: 60 mM mucosal acetate abruptly ( < or = 75 minutes) and   irreversibly abolished lsc at pH < or = 4.5, whereas R decreased more slowly.  These data were associated with cell swelling and vesicle formation in mid-zonal   layers, followed by sloughing of the outer barrier, erosion into deeper zones,  and finally, ulceration. Mucosal HCl at pH > 1.5 was ineffective; however, at pH   1.5, HCl induced an abrupt decrease in R, followed by a slow decrease in lsc, an   effect opposite to that caused by SCFA. Serosal addition of HCl rapidly abolished  lsc suggesting a barrier to free H+ diffusion from the mucosal solution.  CONCLUSIONS: Undissociated SCFA rapidly penetrate the outer barrier and acidify  underlying viable tissue. Cellular acidification inhibits Na pumping and  osmoregulation, resulting in cell swelling and necrosis. In contrast, HCl induces  and increase in outer barrier permeability before accessing the transporting  cells, a much longer process ( > or = 5 hours) requiring a lower pH. These  studies suggest that microbial production of SCFA may be important in the  pathogenesis of porcine gastric ulcers.
