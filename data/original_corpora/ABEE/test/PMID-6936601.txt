Genetic interactions in the control of mitochondrial functions in Paramecium. I.   Interactions between nuclear genes.

The genetic and physiological properties of two nuclear mutants of Paramecium  tetraurelia affecting mitochondrial properties, and first screened as resistant  to tetrazolium (TTC) are described. The mutant TTC64-1R is strongly deficient in   cytochrome c and the mutant TTC66pR is partially deficient in cytochrome aa3;  both mutants display cyanide insensitive respiration in exponential growth phase.  In the double mutant TTC64-1R -- TTC66pR/TTC64-1R -- TTC66pR the deficiency in  cytochrome aa3 due to the TTC66pR mutation is suppressed. The mutation TTC64-1R  does not suppress cytochrome aa3 deficiencies due to mitochondrial mutations, but  does interact with another nuclear mutation, cl1, (compatible only with  mitochondria deficient in cytochrome oxidase) in such a way that the double  mutant TTC64-1R -- cl1/TTC64-1R -- cl1 displays a normal amount of cytochrome  aa3. The possible mechanisms and physiological significance of these suppressive   effects are discussed.
