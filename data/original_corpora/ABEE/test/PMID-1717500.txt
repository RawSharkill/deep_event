Bacterial resistances to mercury and copper.

Heavy metals are toxic to living organisms. Some have no known beneficial  biological function, while others have essential roles in physiological  reactions. Mechanisms which deal with heavy metal stress must protect against the  deleterious effects of heavy metals, yet avoid depleting the cell of a heavy  metal which is also an essential nutrient. We describe the mechanisms of  resistance in Escherichia coli to two different heavy metals, mercury and copper.  Resistance of E. coli to mercury is reasonably well understood and is known to  occur by transport of mercuric ions into the cytoplasmic compartment of the  bacterial cell and subsequent reductive detoxification of mercuric ions. Recent  mutational analysis has started to uncover the mechanistic detail of the mercuric  ion transport processes, and has shown the essential nature of cysteine residues   in transport of Hg(II). Resistance to copper is much less well understood, but is  known to involve the increased export of copper from the bacterial cell and  modification of the copper; the details of the process are still being  elucidated. Expression of both metal resistance determinants is regulated by the   corresponding cation. In each case the response enables the maintenance of  cellular homeostasis for the metal. The conclusions drawn allow us to make  testable predictions about the regulation of expression of resistance to other  heavy metals.
