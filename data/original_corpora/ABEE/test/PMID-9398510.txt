Pactamycin resistance mutations in functional sites of 16 S rRNA. 

Mutants of an archaeon Halobacterium halobium, resistant to the universal  inhibitor of translation, pactamycin, were isolated. Pactamycin resistance  correlated with the presence of mutations in the 16 S rRNA gene of H. halobium  single rRNA operon. Three types of mutations were found in pactamycin resistant  cells, A694G, C795U and C796U (Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA numeration) located  distantly in rRNA primary structure but probably neighboring each other in the  three-dimensional structure. Pactamycin resistance mutations either overlapped  (C795U) or were located in the immediate vicinity of nucleotides protected by the  drug in E. coli and H. halobium 16 S rRNA indicating that corresponding rRNA  sites might be directly involved in pactamycin binding. Ribosomal functions were   not affected significantly either by mutation of C795 (one of the positions  protected by the P-site-bound tRNA), or by mutations of A694 and C796 (which  neighbor nucleotides protected by tRNA) suggesting that tRNA-dependent  protections of C795 and G693 are explained by a conformational change in the  ribosome induced by the P-site-bound tRNA. A novel mode of pactamycin action is  proposed suggesting that pactamycin restricts structural transitions in 16 S rRNA  preventing the ribosome from adopting a functional conformation induced by tRNA  binding.
