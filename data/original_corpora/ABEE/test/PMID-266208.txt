Activation of the alternative complement pathway due to resistance of  zymosan-bound amplification convertase to endogenous regulatory mechanisms.

The surface of zymosan (Zy), by affording a protected microenvironment for C3b  and the amplification convertase stabilized by properdin, P,C3b,Bb, shifts the  alternative complement pathway from slow fluid phase turnover to the  amplification phase of its expression. This mode of activation is in  contradistinction to that of the classical pathway, which follows conversion of a  proenzyme, Cl, to its active form, C1. Under conditions in which the control  proteins, C3b inactivator (C3bINA) and beta1H, completely, inactivated C3b on the  sheep erythrocyte intermediate, EAC4b,3b, the activity of C3b bound to Zy,ZyC3b,   was diminished by only one-third. Further, when ZyC3b was converted to ZyC3b,Bb,P  there was an additional point of deregulation in that the convertase was  resistant to beta1H-mediated decay-dissociation while P,C3b,Bb on the sheep  erythrocyte exhibited the usual susceptibility to beta1H. That Zy alone could  indeed promote rapid C3 cleavage by the alternative pathway through assembly and   protection of the amplification convertase on its surface was demonstrated with a  mixture of alternative pathway proteins, C3,B,D,P, C3bINA, and beta1H, that had  each been purified to homogeneity. Interaction of these proteins at one-tenth  their relative serum concentrations with Zy permitted low-grade inactivation of  C3 and B to advance to the level of amplification after a 15 min lag period.  Because the reaction of the purified proteins proceeded spontaneously when either  regulatory protein was deleted, the effect of Zy was attributed to deregulation  rather than to conversion of one of the proteins to a specific initiating state.   The alternative pathway, through the normal presence of D, interacts with a  microbial surface, such as Zy, to amplify deposition of C3b by circumvention of  endogenous regulatory mechanisms, thereby augmenting host defense.
