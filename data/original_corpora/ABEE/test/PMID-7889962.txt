Non-canonical mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

Although the current in vitro methods used for detection and analysis of the  phenotypes of antibiotic resistance in the laboratory are well established, other  resistance mechanisms of resistance exist which may escape detection using the  standard approach. The present article reviews some of these mechanisms which are  grouped under the term 'non-canonical mechanisms' of antibiotic resistance. Such   mechanisms include gene dosage, heterologous induction or selection, populational  resistance and synergism between mechanisms of low resistance. The role of these   mechanisms in the failure of therapy is discussed.
