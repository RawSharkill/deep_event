Detection and identification of activated oncogenes in human skin cancers  occurring on sun-exposed body sites.

High-molecular-weight DNA isolated from eight fresh human skin cancers occurring   on sun-exposed body sites were assayed for their ability to transform NIH 3T3  cells. A cotransfection protocol using pSV2-neo DNA, which confers resistance to   the antibiotic G418, was used to select cells that had taken up the transfected  DNA. About 2 weeks after transfection, G418-resistant colonies were pooled and  injected s.c. into athymic nude mice. The NIH 3T3 cells transfected with DNA from  six of the human skin cancers induced tumors in nude mice. DNAs from all six  tumor cell lines contained human alu sequences. Southern blot hybridization with   ras-specific probes revealed that DNAs from the four alu-rich tumors contained  the human Ha-ras oncogene, in addition to that of the NIH 3T3 controls. In  contrast, DNAs from the other two tumors did not contain any of the known  oncogenes tested, except those endogenous to NIH 3T3 cells. DNAs from three of  four first cycle tumorigenic transformants gave rise to morphologically  transformed foci when assayed in a second cycle of transfection. DNAs from all  three secondary transformants contained discrete human alu sequences, and in  addition, contained Ha-ras sequences similar to those present in their respective  primary transformants. Interestingly, DNA from both primary and secondary  transformants of one particular human squamous cell carcinoma contained highly  amplified copies of the Ha-ras oncogene. These results suggest that activation of  the Ha-ras oncogene may be common in human skin cancers originating on  sun-exposed body sites. Further characterization of the Ha-ras oncogenes present   in these human skin cancers may provide information on the molecular mechanisms  by which UV radiation of the sun induces human neoplasms on exposed body sites.
