Spontaneous point mutations that occur more often when advantageous than when  neutral.

Recent reports have called into question the widespread belief "that mutations  arise continuously and without any consideration for their utility" (in the words  of J. Cairns) and have suggested that some mutations (which Cairns called  "directed" mutations) may occur as specific responses to environmental  challenges, i.e., they may occur more often when advantageous than when neutral.   In this paper it is shown that point mutations in the trp operon reverted to trp+  more frequently under conditions of prolonged tryptophan deprivation when the  reversions were advantageous, than in the presence of tryptophan when the  reversions were neutral. The overall mutation rate, as determined from the rates   of mutation to valine resistance and to constitutive expression of the lac  operon, did not increase during tryptophan starvation. The trp reversion rate did  not increase when the cells were starved for cysteine for a similar period,  indicating that the increased reversion rate was specific to conditions where the  reversions were advantageous. Two artifactual explanations for the observations,   delayed growth of some preexisting revertants and cryptic growth by some cells at  the expense of dying cells within aged colonies, were tested and rejected as  unlikely. The trp+ reversions that occurred while trp- colonies aged in the  absence of tryptophan were shown to be time-dependent rather than  replication-dependent, and it is suggested that they occur by mechanisms  different from those that have been studied in growing cells. A heuristic model  for the molecular basis of such mutations is proposed and evidence consistent  with that model is discussed. It is suggested that the results in this and  previous studies can be explained on the basis of underlying random mechanisms  that act during prolonged periods of physiological stress, and that "directed"  mutations are not necessarily the basis of those observations.
