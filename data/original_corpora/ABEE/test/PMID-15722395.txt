Comparison of multidrug resistance gene regions between two geographically  unrelated Salmonella serotypes. 

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify chromosomally integrated genes   conferring multidrug resistance to a Salmonella enterica (S.) serotype  Typhimurium isolate, phage type DT193, isolated in Ireland and to compare them  with resistance genes conferring plasmid-mediated multidrug resistance to a S.  Enteritidis isolate from Italy. METHODS: A complete DNA sequence of the regions  containing the resistance genes was obtained from the chromosome of the S.  Typhimurium DT193 isolate and from the IncI plasmid of the S. Enteritidis  isolate. The plasmid was also characterized by conjugation and incompatibility  grouping. RESULTS: Two 10 kb multidrug resistance non-Salmonella Genomic Island 1  type clusters were independently identified in the S. Enteritidis plasmid and in   the chromosome of the S. Typhimurium isolate. Detailed characterization  identified an IP-type 2 integron containing a dfrA1-aadA1 gene cassette and other  common resistance determinants derived from the RSF1010 plasmid. CONCLUSIONS:  These multidrug resistance regions originate following chromosomal integration of  key resistance markers encountered on plasmids circulating in other Salmonella  serotypes. This mechanism of marker acquisition may have future implications for   the evolution of similar structures in previously susceptible serotypes, leading   to an increased public health risk.
