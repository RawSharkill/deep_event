[Tuberculosis in low prevalence countries. Back to the future?].

The incidence of tuberculosis has declined in all European countries in this  century but in several countries the decline has come to a stop. Microscopy a.m.   Ziehl-Neelsen and culture are still the mainstays in the diagnosis of  tuberculosis but new DNA-technics such as PCR and RFLP are increasingly used. The  tuberculin test is hitherto the only practically feasible test for identification  of subjects infected with M. tuberculosis. BCG is the most used vaccine in the  world but the protective mechanisms are not fully understood and the efficacy  controversial. Immunotherapy with M. vaccae may be used as an adjuvant to  chemotherapy. Few cases of tuberculosis are observed in AIDS-patients in Denmark.  Modern standard treatment of tuberculosis comprises a six-month regimen with  isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and possibly ethambutol. Multidrug resistance  in tuberculosis is rare in Western Europe. Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid is  debatable. Patients with smear-positive sputum may be infectious whereas patients  with extrapulmonary tuberculosis normally pose no risk.
