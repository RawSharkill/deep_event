Characterization of DIM-1, an integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a  Pseudomonas stutzeri clinical isolate in the Netherlands. 

A carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas stutzeri strain isolated from a Dutch patient   was analyzed in detail. This isolate produced a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)  whose gene, with 43.5% GC content, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli.   beta-Lactamase DIM-1 (for Dutch imipenemase) was weakly related to other Ambler  class B beta-lactamases, sharing <52% amino acid identity with the most closely  related MBL, GIM-1, and 45% identity with IMP-type MBLs. The beta-Lactamase DIM-1  significantly hydrolyzed broad-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems and spared  aztreonam. This MBL gene was embedded in a class 1 integron containing two other   gene cassettes, encoding resistance to aminoglycosides and disinfectants, that  was located on a 70-kb plasmid.
